[12/5/18, 8:57:25 PM] <GarfieldTheMondayKiller> cheer100 Garf thought of a strange scenario. If there was a week long Purge who are 2 guys you'd trust to protect you? Stipulation, you can pick fictional charactersbut they can't have superpowers, so Batman would be allowed but can only use gadgets that exist in real life. Despite the person's personality they won't be capable of turning against you, so if you hire the Joker he can only protect you but be brutal towards trespassers. Garf would choose Mr.Rogers and Pooh they're too pure to hurt
