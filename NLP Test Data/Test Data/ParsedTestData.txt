n so has wolf risen on your tier list?
n let me see your squirtle big boy
n @jawbba yea it does theres a vid on how parries work on yt
n @lffn do you ever use instant dash attacks with double stick?
n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5jo-ucki-y&t=531s link to fox shine spiking in ultimate: 4:51

n leff vs zero evo 20xx? mangopog
n @lffn no you were describing everything perfectly, like the connections wrere perfect

n @uw_yarfy thank you for that image, i was looking for that info. that's about what i was expecting, everything being so similar that distinguishing is pointless beyond preference.
n smol robert
n pokemon pogchamp
n so has wolf risen on your tier list?
n still didnt change controls lol
s robert ok
n @nachmach1 internet. sweden to usa would be bad
n muscle memory
n @lffn does the gcc have more input lag?
n did you watch bsd new tech video it shows how you can extend your dash grab distance
n leff using gc or pro controller?
n incineroar kreygasm
n @foxrunshinenair no, the controllers are basically the same
n it‚Äôs crazy how careful they have to be with patches
n @pelagius_hipbone_ it's just that you can get away with a ton of scrubby shit in smash 4 and the scrubs in that game aren't lasting in ultimate
n leff is using joy-con
n 4head gotem
n check out leffen's most recent youtube videos! subscribe to https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc-shc38nmbny5fiurgvggsw
n did someone1 clip the parry/
n ?
n !controller
n leffen is using a gamecube controller with c-stick tilt, tap jump off, and regular sensitivity. other controllers and setups are viable though.
n do you have a advice how we should approach the game for getting better?
n okay thanks. @lffn will tilts on c stick fuck me up when i go back to melee?
n dammn sick kill
n so is high sens tilt stick the meta?
s single joycon for best smash ultimate controller kappa
n @muhatheman +1 i have the same question
n @scrubbysheik sens is irrelevant
n chat, we gotta make sure leffen watches the best video in history pls https://twitter.com/bel_cf/status/1071466785889693696
n high sens is a myth
n @sunderkeenin for real tho
n incinebore
s i play ultimate with motion controls
s furry vs furry pogchamp
s guitar hero guitar is best controller
n what does it actually do?
n what is tap jump and why does leff have it off
n big leff the goat
n @scrubbysheik high sense is a hoax
n lffnez
n lol
n tap jump is if you use control stick up you jump
n leff has tap jump off?
n holy shit
n what
n i feel like leffen is winning more constantly than top smash 4 players...
n tap jump off means you have to press a button to jump
n uh oh :)
n he had revenge
n monkas
n pogchamp wow
n is that sarcasm lol
n i dont think that rage monkas
n rage xd
n what stage rules does leffen run?
n lffnrage lffnrage lffnrage
n hahahahaha
n holy shit @kiant2911 thats tso funny
n does leff ever fight viewers?
n range in this game is only like 20% more lul
n im so used to smash stick in smash 4 that im not sure how to transition to tilt stick. should i even bother
n i think you got deleted cuz he had revenge still
n i heard rage is max 1.1x multiplier
n calm down
n it was his counter breh
n hey lffnego
s i love rest. rest is such a good mechanic. kappa
n it's a 10% boost at max lol
s ok leffen actually hates the game lul
n @vizi33 i'm on the same page
n that's nothing
n rage is max 1.15 i believe
n how would up b out of shield work without tap jump tho
n more lasers üòí
n leffen will be streaming ultimate 10+ hours every day trying to become the best. follow to see more or sub for these great emotes: lffns lffnrage lffnyikes lffnwoah lffntrainer lffnez lffnnom lffnsnack lffnthink lffnw lffnfox
n i hope you can tell us how we should approach the game for learning it ^^ @lffn
n @armoflame u see? pls help so he watches it xd
n it was changed to 1.1x @armoflame
n yee
n ooooo
n @lonelyintrovert you just slide jump to b, like instant pin
n i love how you get rage at 120 now instead of asap lol
n !controller leffen is using a gamecube controller with c-stick tilt, tap jump off, and regular sensitivity. other controllers and setups are viable. gcc or pro controller lag is a myth.

n yeah kiant its so hilarious
n are you entering ultimate at g6?

n chat, we gotta make sure leffen watches the best video in history pls https://twitter.com/bel_cf/status/1071466785889693696
n ayy
n you guys are acting like 1.1 isnt noticable
n pog
n oof
n ah
n can you buffer jump out of shield with c stick like melee?
n @lonelyintrovert you can do upb and up smash out of shield directly in this game. no need to jump iirc.
s skill is for losers
n leggo
n @lffn change controllers!
n ooo
n wp
n let's go!
n lol i leave for 5 hours, come back, and he's still robert?
n n i c e b a i r
n @lffn zero said your tier list is shit
n @nekrome_ yes
n !controller
n worth buying a switch if i never played a smash game?
n is pikachu as good as everyone says?
n way more pogchamp
n is bara cat actually good?
n @peyton sick
n look up the revenge mechanic
n zer0 said 4head
n well i mean someone paid 70$ for robert
n @milkteacactuar i thought he stopped the top dono thing
n it's only 1.1x
n @steftricky yrses
n z e r omegalul
n i've heard it's like 30% nerf from smash 4
n isn't it hard to up-b out of shield without tap jump
n so only 10 percent yeah
n yeah
n 1.1x
n someone should lab it
n i miss melee
n is pikachu as good as everyone says?
n that throw just did like 35%
n yeah it's 10%
n chat, we gotta make sure leffen watches the best video in history pls https://twitter.com/bel_cf/status/1071466785889693696
n zero mangolul
n that lost thing was cuz of revenge not rage
n @lffn incineroar hit very hard
n @lffn controllersssssss
n how many tournament you enter xd
n it was 1.3x before i think
n should i bind l for jump?
n smash 4 was 1.15 this is 1.1
n it was 15% before.
n @kiant2911 bruh stuop
n oh nvm
n it's literally confirmed to be 1.1x now
n zero would be the guy to judge a day 1 tier list lul
n imagine recovering with wolf omegalul
n it‚Äôs like 1.1 now
n isnt it 10%damage boost, but its knockback calc gets affected more by that 10%
n thats just incineroar not rage
n it used to be 1.15
n @yemane i think they made it so you can up b oos without having ti jump
n wolf pog
n any amount of rage is too much rage
n in smash 4
n ohmydog vs. coolcat
n yeah at max rage it was 1.15x
n rage is fine smorc
n in smash 4
n capped at 150 percent
n sourpls
n sourpls
n so now it‚Äôs 1.1 since they took off 33%
n people just underestimate how fast 10% scales and becomes ridiculous.
n destroyed skyworld pogchamp
n so rage is still a mechanic in smash ultimate?
n dope fd
n thank you for subbing, alectrazz1231! :d :d
n pogchamp
n the biggest issue with rage in s4 was that it affected set knockback (wbkb), they got rid of that and lowered max rage from 1.15 to 1.1
n this upsmash is so sad
n dont think aleks is coming back after this game
n i wish man
n rage is alright tbh, as long as it doesnt do dumb shit like smash 4 ladder combos killing at like 10
n @lffn zero said falco is mid tier at best
n nier in smash is the dream
n @twobeansinapot previous rage only affected knowckback
n that's what i thought
n definitely sounds like nier
n thats what i thought too with nier
n !controls
n ata mata
n i thought the same thing
n yes rage is still in just less stupid
n ezg
n what pogchamp
n nier would be dope
n lul
n i'd be down for 2b in smash
n theres not used to people what? @lffn
n dude, imagine, 2b as a dlc character and nier automata remixes in smash.. i would die of excitement
n lul lul lul
n what is this music
n shame there are too many anime swordsman for 2b to get in
n lul
n i was thinking this was nier also lmao
n anyone know if ledgedashing is a thing or nah, havent gotten to watch too much of ult
n rage more like casual party game
s 'i sucked so i should do better'
n can you turn off rage on this?
n isnt it kind of like x factor in marvel?
n end rage culture
n "that would have killed if i got hit more" 4head
n ban the rage lovers
n lul
n 2b could still make it idgaf about soul calibur 7
n 6
n ppl think rage is fine because its worse than in tr4sh. its still a bad mechanic...
n it only works in tekken 7
n rage is awful, but i can understand the logic behind it. buffs heavys but nerfs fast lightweigths. it is awful though.
n its a comeback mechanik :)
n @jscizor kid icarus music
n i really want to see what a good incineroar can do
n the "good" way to look at rage is that it is a tool to punihs safe percentage building
n after joker 2b seems surprisingly realistic
n lffnw this is a rage free zone lffnw
n rage is a brawl tripping tier mechanic
n nier automata remixes in smash would be too good we dont deserve it
n when you shoot up the credits after classic mode as 2b it plays weight of the world, imagine pogchamp
n lord leff
n people who are okay with xfactor in mvc3 are okay with rage
n valhalla 2 (jan 3-7)
n rage punishes you for being good
n former toxic player here no rage chat >:(
n can't rage be turned completely off in this?
n can rage be turned off??
n whats wrong with the ntecode
n i think rage was made to encourage people at high percent to fight and not stall
n actually rage is great and i have no lag so online is fine brokeback
n lol this reminds me of the leffen rant of smash 4 about "but my niece doesent like losing" lol
n @upgradebob no rage is not like x factor
n can you actually ledgehop laser thats so funny
n the rage mechanic, brought to you by the people who thought random tripping was good
n rage is dumb. it's tolerable and bad, not something good for the game.
n rage isnt that big of a deal but its still dum
n lffnrage
s it just advantages getting bodied kappa
n more rage! swiftrage
n some people think rage is hype basically, cause it makes twitch clips
n positive vibez
n @
n rage is a catch-up mechanic lul
n more rage kappa
n do you still think theres no reason to play wolf over falco
n taro would add papa nier to troll everyone at the same time
n rage type mechanics are in a lot of new fighting games
n rage is bad design game
n rage in smash 4 literally enabled me to get comebacks at 200% on roy
n no
n leffen hows wavedashing?
n rubber banding lul
n unlike the netcode rage is less worse than in smash 4 @lffn
n rage is the opposite of hype
n hi im smash noob what does rage do
n rage is garbo
s im ok with it - heavy main
n rage rewards you for getting hit
n what the fuck is an incineroar
n rage is a catch-up mechanic for casuals lol
n rage is just a comeback mechanic but it is a llittle rediculous a heavy who is super hard to kill and hit like trucks get bonus damage and knockback thats just stupid
n its for clips and for casuals. most people playing this game are just playing with friends for fun
n rage to balance heavies?
n pichu self inducing rage lul
n it was to make heavys more viable i belive
n !tierlist
n smash 4 players logic failfish
n ultimate tierlist: https://twitter.com/tsm_leffen/status/1071180250434953216 melee: https://twitter.com/tsm_leffen/status/1054103182572429312
n you have a tier list
n rage bad, but lucario aura is kinda cool
n rage isn't catch up, since you can stay ahead at high percentage. it's to punish safe play from the low percent guy
n uh oh the other player is at high percent, better stay away
n it's just too broad and general of a mechanic anyways, seems dumb to try and balance the combat with a such a sweeping mechanic like that
n rage gives love for the heavies
n @lffn is it bad
n rage in this game start at 120% no?
n why does smash 4 and its players get such a bad rap? its the only smash i never played so i don‚Äôt know what was wrong with it?
n rage made lucario top tier and dumb
n the point of rage is to buff heavyweights, but it's a trash way of doing so.
n the biggest change to rage was that they stopped it affecting wbkb @lffn
n do you play competive ultimate in tournements?in ultimate?
n rage in smash 4 made people fish for broken kill setups
n is leffen a wolf main?
n think about lucario in smash 4, did you ever like fighting him? that's legit just rage on steroids and it's jank and stupid as fuck
n the only logical thing about rage is comeback factor but thats stupid either way
n loofen
n idk what it is with game designers and comeback mechanics
n @pelagius_hipbone_ evo finals
n rage is just another crappy mechanic for scrubs
n rage just killed the game and made it really cheesy
n rage = when at high damage, your moves are stronger
n rage makes % combos variable
n am i back in time for robert?
n cause it'll always have unforeseen consequences
n rip robert
n if you are in favor of rage you have either never gone to a smash tournament or go 2 and out every week
n @lffn is wolf's instant side b from ledge actually any good?
n the stats dont lie
n are you digging wolf more than falco now?
n @lffn play falco dude. prove zero wrong
n @siglemic gen 7 fire starting pokemon
n so does leffen like wolf better than falco now? lul
n does this mean you don't have a good opinion of lucario? @lffn
n guar plain pogchamp
n can you show ur ccontroller ? @lffn
n kk
n its not that bad but it shouldn't be in
n the more percent you take, let's say you're at 100 percent, the more knockback you inflict @808brodie
n ivysaur beats k rool tell ur friends
n rage is a mechanic that just makes marthritis worse for characters that can't kill and allows stupid comebacks when you're getting fucking destroyed
n @tlpaidbysteve ohh okay thank yoy
n rage is just a casual mechanic lffnw
n does anyone know if this game is bad or not
n rage start at 120% lul
n hey leff, how's your day going?
n lol sig
n no robert?
n lffnwhip1 lffnwhip1 lffnwhip2
n @pelagius_hipbone_ a lot slower and simpler than melee, so when melee players try to play it it feels slow and boring
n @seanroni thanks dude!
n at least this game is already better than sm4sh
n justatestbro well people are mostly coming from melee in this stream, so they're going to complain. it's a pretty stupid mechanic.
n exactly
n there shuold defs be a rage toggle
n any gifters in chat heyguys
n in smash 4 start at 1% lul
n its fun
n if you have high percent you cant ca.p because then you woild even be further behind,rage is just something that was introduced into smash 4 because the games would go to long
n steamroll mechanic
n whats his gsp
n it also makes leads stronger year
n crouch canceling is better than rage for comebacks and heavys
n no it counts if your down a stock too
n @808brodie :d
n could you maybe play a match with chrom or incineroar, trying to understand them more
n rage is bullshit and makes heavy characters inherently better late game
n its a snowball mechanic rather than a comeback mechanic
n rage is made for trash players like every single game those days
n if you are in favor of rage you have either never gone to a smash tournament or go 2 and out every week
n welcome kanda_panda! :d :d :d
n why don't u just play the big croc @lffn
n @lffn what do you think about wolf?
n cc is a bad mechanic too
n any update to the tier list?
n stock count affects rage no?
n holy shit apparently zero saying no one giving a fuck about falco, all top players practicing inkling
n still robert
n @beedlebeedle ahh okay thank you. would you say it was worse than brawl?
n what ccontroller you using ? @lffn
n rage doesn't need to exist in ultimate
n oh hey siglemic is here
n who is robert
n play the handsome one
n @siglemic the croc is i g n o r a n t
n l
n who is by far best character
n !controller
n leffen is using a gamecube controller with c-stick tilt, tap jump off, and regular sensitivity. other controllers and setups are viable. gcc or pro controller lag is a myth.
n when is the first official 5mash tourney?
n join leffens discord, it's open to everyone: discord.gg/gn5ve7h lffnw
n wolf's aerials look sick pogchamp
n anyone know who the top tier character is
n !tierlist

n lul
n the amount of super armor on k rool is o b s c e n e
n rude
n good :d
n @nekrome_ there was a tournament yesterday
n @nekrome_ the first big one will be genesis 6
n was this the brawl that shoulda been?
s leffen kicked zero out of stream
n @yaboycheezy sword characters
n lolol
n cc rewards being at a lower percent and gets countered by grab and other char dependent options
s out of tsm
n lul
n damn you put link on the bottom? lol
n it's not even comparable to rage
n i keep trying to l cancel in this game
n loool
n but zero said
n zero's tier list is trash lol
n i thought rage was removed, its a option now right?
n he betrayed tsm
n oh sick @thegravytrainttk and @httrkaiser
n but zero said
n link to zeros tier list
n leffen doesnt like zero?
n !help
n whats the easiest way to learn game mechanics? in game experience or watching videos
n but
n buttttttt
n @lffn what's your opinion on diddy
n lmao too early for that tier list stuff
n @yinyang0427 wolf looked sick in brawl too. it's just that the entire game was meta knight. we're actually getting to see wolf be awesome now
n @pelagius_hipbone_ definitely not. i think brawl was the lowest point in smash and i think most people agree. every game since then has been an improvement tho imo
n !command
n i don't think smash even needs a comeback mechanic like rage.
n i was one of the people saying that
n @marron02 did that actually happen lol
n but zero
s wow leffen's ego gets inflated even on the john lffnego
n zero thinks he knows everything
n notatk why dont you care about my opeeeeenion?? notatk
n smash 4 pros are all huddling around 3 characters zzzzzzzzzzz
n is leffen gonna play sm5sh competitivly???
n leffen and zero they rival
n leffen still right
n leffen and zero are both tsm of course they like eachother
n @bronxbomber517 nah i just joking xd
n zero streams for virgins
n there is no need for comeback mechanic at all
n @mrman4321 that's why the tier list is a discussion piece, not a final statement of position
n zero vs leffen in future xd
n tier whore zero
n leffen will you main wolf?
n rip yoshi if you dont get jump back
n people can be wrong, why do you guys have a problem with zero being wrong?
n @yaboycheezy zero on temppo storm now
n leffen vs zero salty suite pog
n i'm not sure if leffen hates the guy. probably disagrees with him is all
n another space animal?
n zero isnt tsm
n zero isnt tsm anymore
n lol leffen has 3x more viewers than the reads holiday bash streamed by mang0
n inb4 grand finals falco dittos leffen vs zero
n evthmos which 3?
n zero is tempo storm
n how hard is wall teching here? i haven't seen anyone successfully tech a wall spike
n thoughts on corrin?
n well zero is tempo but okay
n thoughts on zero's new tier list?
n leffen doesn't hate zero lul
s robert tier list when?
n i feel like ever melee player plays this game like a scared little kid except armada and leffen
n what makes falco so good he seems average to me
n leff why do you rate olimar so bad
n doesn't diddy's banan make him ungrabable
n zero doesnt think he knows everything he just gives his thought on it xd
n who wants to see leffen vs zero? falco/pkmt vs chrom
n bayonetta? what about her, i feel she was significantly nerfed
n i just wanna see the melee players shit on the smash4 players lffnez
n @mnchngrngs because he acts like he knows everything
n imagine leaving tsm to go to tempo storm lul
n cant wait for leffen to talk mad smack at ultimate summit
n are you paid to be in clan like tsm
n ye ofc @sunderkeenin some characters feel a lot better then others
n inkling chrome and pika frmo what i see
n gotta love the ballsack in the background
n aerials for days pogchamp
n did zero leave tsm???
n leffen has lots of respect for zero, he just doesn't agree
n i just wanna see the smash4 players shit on melee play- 4head
n zero's chat honestly think inklings is #1 in the game, and zero himself thinks the meta is going to be boring as fuck now.
n i wonder how they will handle invites for ultimate summit
n @bigmoule008 yes
n lul
n background ballsack pogchamp
n lffnrage lffnrage lffnrage
n dbfz player here.. you're telling me every character gets a rage mechanic in this gmae?
n ah yeah makes sense mangodone
n wow who many xd
n thanks for subbing, squirt01! <3 <3 <3
n babyrage
n like come on dude, it's been like 3 days and zero acts like the game is dead like smash 4
n how*
n to be fair ganon getting two hits in melee usually ties things up lul
n is rage only for certain characters?
n shits worst than sfv vtrigger lol
n @shibbywan unfortunately yes
n babyrage
n is there actually a rage toggle lime people thought?
n @shibbywan every character has rage yes. in smash 4 it led to a lot of really jank kill setups
n rage is just ridiculously stupid, why would you punish a player for playing well
n zero needs some melee in his life
s getting faired by ganon. "rage"
n heavys shouldnt get rage because of how hard they can be to kill
n does rage reduce kb on the char. with rage? while also increasing their kb?
n babyrage
n what the hell
n if melee was a 10 and smash 4 a 1, what would you rate ultimate (i know its only after 3 days or so, but still)
n you're right :(
n @maxroberts78787 you have not see furry art then
