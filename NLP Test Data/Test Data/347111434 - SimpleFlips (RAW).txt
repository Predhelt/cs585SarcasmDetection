[12/9/18, 11:00:37 PM] <Potomace> like humantas
[12/9/18, 11:00:48 PM] <PiManAndTheIrrationals> Simple, what do you think about GSA partnering with a betting site? Do you think it will be good or cause more harm in the long run?
[12/9/18, 11:00:48 PM] <GuntherRidel> what's human theory for 70 star
[12/9/18, 11:00:49 PM] <Thegamemaster03> Clip dat cause I dont know how to :p

[12/9/18, 11:01:16 PM] <Pobreza_Guatemalteca> Its basically a TAS but with believable tricks, tactics and movements
[12/9/18, 11:01:19 PM] <rickyw11577> You're definitely not doing bad this run! You were much sloppier last night, and you still got very close!
[12/9/18, 11:01:25 PM] <justsomesush> How's my boy Nathaniel Scuttlegoomba Parabug Bandimore doing
[12/9/18, 11:01:36 PM] <theshoover> Gambling real money with speedruns is just so... not going anywhere well
[12/9/18, 11:02:02 PM] <dlivie1> gaming money in speedruns is stupider then playing slots
[12/9/18, 11:02:05 PM] <ribbonheartflat> you gotta crack a few eggs to make an idiot omlet
[12/9/18, 11:02:08 PM] <dlivie1> gaming money
[12/9/18, 11:02:09 PM] <PiManAndTheIrrationals> So, basically when they get big, probably move away from that, sounds respectable.
[12/9/18, 11:02:10 PM] <Kratok> What does speedrunning as an esport actually look like?
[12/9/18, 11:02:10 PM] <dlivie1> i meant gambling

[12/9/18, 11:02:48 PM] <russellsapphire> Thanks! >w<
[12/9/18, 11:02:51 PM] <theshoover> I don't watch GSA anymore if gambling is involved just because it feels out of character for a speedrunning community to allow that. Even sponsorships were finme.
[12/9/18, 11:02:55 PM] <Potomace> I think that's an interesting perspective, people say when you gewt famous you turn your back on your early supporters, but I guess when you start you're desperate and you can leave them later
[12/9/18, 11:02:58 PM] <Headlocke> this is a banger

[12/9/18, 11:35:16 PM] <AndreBetterfall> Pannenkoek be like: When your speed is x, you gain speed backwards by adding exponential value to your current speed and then you go faster so you clip through objects because the hit box only responds to certain speeds
[12/9/18, 11:35:17 PM] <Mr_Garo> Not enough flames imo
[12/9/18, 11:35:19 PM] <1ted59> I don't think thats true

[12/10/18, 12:08:15 AM] <dlivie1> chaos > kaizo due to funness because chaos is more random but kiazo > chaos in gameplay since its always the same
[12/10/18, 12:08:15 AM] <andreskeyva> aah
[12/10/18, 12:08:17 AM] <Dampharos> So normal mario 64 is worse than this
[12/10/18, 12:08:17 AM] <Iinneus> Chaos Mario is such a different mindset, though. Chaos Mario is never "man i gotta play better to overcome the water suddenly disappearing"
[12/10/18, 12:08:18 AM] <htxdiario> this is definitely a game
[12/10/18, 12:08:18 AM] <PiManAndTheIrrationals> Download Super Mario Galaxy from the Wii U eshop if this gets too much for you.

[12/10/18, 12:38:25 AM] <Theleathal0ne> horrible note hour long note
[12/10/18, 12:38:26 AM] <Kratok> Did he just make the vanish cap shorter and the song is getting clipped?
[12/10/18, 12:38:29 AM] <Brian_B_> Wherefore is sound?
[12/10/18, 12:38:29 AM] <ClaydolFiddler> how much is sound?

[12/10/18, 12:38:31 AM] <Althor> Of course, now that I've said that...
[12/10/18, 12:38:33 AM] <loohhoo> maybe something was slightly overwritten on accident
[12/10/18, 12:38:35 AM] <CosmicAngel233> <ballsacking engage>
[12/10/18, 12:38:35 AM] <cephalosapien> has to be something with the immediate cutoff
[12/10/18, 12:38:36 AM] <jayttt> Why is sound?
[12/10/18, 12:38:36 AM] <Little_Tub> Not a midi right
[12/10/18, 12:38:37 AM] <justsomesush> OH WOW YOU BEAT THE GAME

[12/10/18, 12:38:39 AM] <GhostSonic> @Althor You need to clarify what that meant
[12/10/18, 12:38:39 AM] <terribleme36> wait what happened to sound where did he go thus time
[12/10/18, 12:38:39 AM] <xraytodoroki> new sound what's sound

[12/10/18, 12:38:43 AM] <xenon_reaction> you practicing 120 star again?
[12/10/18, 12:38:44 AM] <loohhoo> "midi"
[12/10/18, 12:38:45 AM] <cephalosapien> could be related to the rom hack
[12/10/18, 12:38:48 AM] <sparn> bringing it up just makes it seem like you're asking for it
[12/10/18, 12:38:50 AM] <Little_Tub> It's like a midi but worse
[12/10/18, 12:38:51 AM] <downwarddong> maybe something he did messed with the sound compression when a song gets canceled.
[12/10/18, 12:38:51 AM] <T_Dangles> @Althor is confirmed to be ballsack
[12/10/18, 12:39:01 AM] <hero_the_chao> Who is sound?
[12/10/18, 12:39:02 AM] <loohhoo> wait have you been using your sound tool thing
[12/10/18, 12:39:04 AM] <loohhoo> that mutes game music
[12/10/18, 12:39:04 AM] <Zaazu> its because your mixer is wrong @simpleflips Kappa
[12/10/18, 12:39:06 AM] <Triur> hold on just gonna google sm64 free vanish cap midi.exe
[12/10/18, 12:39:06 AM] <uwak5117> yeah it could be because it doesn't fade out
[12/10/18, 12:39:07 AM] <PepprCorn> These so called "midi files"
[12/10/18, 12:39:10 AM] <ティオニシア> @Althor i wont ballsack a desperate man
[12/10/18, 12:39:13 AM] <Little_Tub> ugh
[12/10/18, 12:39:22 AM] <Althor> I'm not desperateteyt
[12/10/18, 12:39:25 AM] <Little_Tub> Surely he isn't
[12/10/18, 12:39:35 AM] <cephalosapien> yeah it's just a hard cutoff so it brings back the stage music
[12/10/18, 12:39:36 AM] <Little_Tub> That'd be mean
[12/10/18, 12:39:37 AM] <pupsrus13> I think the error with the vanish cap music is because it's TOO short, instead of not short enough
[12/10/18, 12:39:38 AM] <ティオニシア> i don't believe you
[12/10/18, 12:39:39 AM] <FrostDragonV22> quick, find the world record.

[12/10/18, 12:52:48 AM] <seanythetank> @Godric16 yeah that's because they skimped out on animation for scenes where the characters werent in combat, so a fight scene looks great but just walking down a corridor is full on barbie and ken mode

[12/10/18, 12:53:52 AM] <ティオニシア> dubs have such a small cast to pull from so it makes some animes really strange
[12/10/18, 12:53:52 AM] <nachoborracho1188> I like subs because sometimes the translations are off and it’s kinda funny lol

[12/10/18, 12:59:02 AM] <Framed> honestly its going to be hard to convince me that the new ultimate isnt just an anime fighting game
[12/10/18, 12:59:06 AM] <Foxen> Most anime is bad, so Mark is kinda right
[12/10/18, 12:59:07 AM] <GhostSonic> I had to figure out if Tub was a legit mad at Markass
[12/10/18, 12:59:12 AM] <Archibaldthered> part 6 is pretty good, but part 7 is where its at
[12/10/18, 12:59:16 AM] <MirorT> @foxyshibata thus spoke rohan kishibe???? its a big ole meme cuz the art style is really...weird

[12/10/18, 12:59:27 AM] <Foxen> Ultimate is an anime fighting game, that's why goku was added

[12/10/18, 1:01:19 AM] <PAK215> THIS is why charged Final Smashes are banned

[12/10/18, 1:01:21 AM] <dinoddaygoatslayerxx1233> Sans would be great in smash
[12/10/18, 1:01:27 AM] <Junkles> sans in smash. also sans is waluigi
[12/10/18, 1:01:30 AM] <CrisM98> can we stop him?
[12/10/18, 1:01:36 AM] <Ebbsbenedict> omg smash tournaments would never end
[12/10/18, 1:01:37 AM] <ButtButtson> @ティオニシア Im also fucking terrified of either him or Minecraft Steve. If either is in I will demand Nintendo return my money
[12/10/18, 1:01:38 AM] <aGlitchh> It starts charging, and you have to wait till the next smash
[12/10/18, 1:01:43 AM] <FrostDragonV22> the most notable thing goku ever did was charged a spirit bomb, atleast in my opinion. no arguments please, I don't watch DBZ. that is why the spirit bomb was notable to me.
[12/10/18, 1:01:47 AM] <blackston221221> me need sleepy beddy time
[12/10/18, 1:01:47 AM] <ティオニシア> minecraft steve or the fortnite guy

[12/10/18, 1:01:49 AM] <BenBenBenBenBenBenBenB> I heard they were gonna add Shrek to smash
[12/10/18, 1:01:50 AM] <cephalosapien> wait does this still have the volcano?
[12/10/18, 1:01:52 AM] <Framed> you have to understand his motivations for dropping half the fuckin planet on his enemy though so its 3 seasons long just to have the spirit bomb only upset the opponent
[12/10/18, 1:01:52 AM] <kogmeroSacoWea> party parrots : )
[12/10/18, 1:01:52 AM] <GhostSonic> Metere'd final smashes are weaker so it only takes like 6 hours instead of a week
[12/10/18, 1:01:55 AM] <sparn> gotta be minecraft steve with that model
[12/10/18, 1:01:57 AM] <Play3rNERD> nvm change that, Goku 8 player smash takes forever
[12/10/18, 1:02:00 AM] <MirorT> @foxyshibata rohan at the lourve isn't animated yet but a few of the thus spoke rohans were. thats why I expect some form of Purple haze feedback

[12/10/18, 1:02:20 AM] <theblj> I want Steve Minecraft, Sans Undertale, and Reimu Touhou to be in Smash

[12/10/18, 1:02:25 AM] <FrostDragonV22> @Framed if DBZ were a speedrun of Mario 64 then the entire speedrun would take 4 seasons and 4 years each season
[12/10/18, 1:02:25 AM] <AngelSassinTV> sans has no right to be in smash. being from an indie game hurts his chances, and he doesn't even have a moveset other than wave his hand. at least Game n Watch, a character with no content, had different sprites.
[12/10/18, 1:02:25 AM] <CHAOS_FANTAZY> This isn't Chaos Mario...

[12/10/18, 1:02:58 AM] <Armless_Steve> I wonder if there are people out there who unironically want Sans in Smash Bros.
[12/10/18, 1:02:59 AM] <ButtButtson> @PiManAndTheIrrationals Why would you want that over actual Nintendo characters though
[12/10/18, 1:03:01 AM] <ティオニシア> touhou in smash would just be mugen
[12/10/18, 1:03:03 AM] <Evan1205gamin> Can I Be Tracer?

[12/10/18, 1:03:52 AM] <ButtButtson> Dude there's more Nintendo characters than you think and Shovel Knight would be boring as heck
[12/10/18, 1:03:52 AM] <Markass> lol

[12/10/18, 1:04:13 AM] <foxyshibata> @MirorT i'd be really exited for that then. my BF really loved Kraftwerk. Would be exited to see him again. Even breifly.
[12/10/18, 1:04:13 AM] <Rabrad27> @pak215, they have a mini costume for every fighter in the game, let me dream.
[12/10/18, 1:04:14 AM] <Baseball1043> that means this IS oatmeal
[12/10/18, 1:04:14 AM] <PAK215> Fogetting his receipt was LITERALLY the DUMBEST thing I've EVER heard anyone do! simHELP

[12/10/18, 1:04:17 AM] <dRmRcOOL> I can't believe luke seward dire dire docks went triple platinum and won an oscar
[12/10/18, 1:04:21 AM] <Evan1205gamin> nerf bastion
[12/10/18, 1:04:25 AM] <PiManAndTheIrrationals> I meant to say all the Nintendo characters that I want are in Ultimate already, and I disagree myself, but that's opinions I guess @ButtButtson
[12/10/18, 1:04:27 AM] <Little_Tub> Because you've had 2 extra dickly heads
[12/10/18, 1:04:36 AM] <Reverend_Badass> @evan1205gamin I can't believe this
[12/10/18, 1:04:37 AM] <Foxen> Shovel Knight wouldn't be a boring character, but I don't think he's been around long enough to be in Smash, personally
[12/10/18, 1:04:37 AM] <FrostDragonV22> @Framed why did you go back for it
[12/10/18, 1:04:39 AM] <Armless_Steve> Shovel Knight would be another anime sword character, but a shovel instead
[12/10/18, 1:04:39 AM] <Play3rNERD> OOF

[12/10/18, 1:04:55 AM] <mboy2000> HE FORGOT THE RECEIPT
[12/10/18, 1:04:59 AM] <ティオニシア> i assumed shovel knight wouldnt get representation in smash cause he's in RoA
[12/10/18, 1:05:03 AM] <ティオニシア> but it was a nice surprise
[12/10/18, 1:05:05 AM] <sparn> shovel knight hasn't been around long enough for smash, so here's the protag of a PS3/PS4 game instead
[12/10/18, 1:05:11 AM] <Farathil_> Alot of people want Geno. but I don't see it happening personally.
[12/10/18, 1:05:11 AM] <Slurpee> Who?

[12/10/18, 1:05:26 AM] <MirorT> whoa he was right
[12/10/18, 1:05:27 AM] <GhostSonic> I don't get how Shove Knight has become like, THE face of indie gaming
[12/10/18, 1:05:28 AM] <ティオニシア> slurpee is an undercover cop cop
[12/10/18, 1:05:30 AM] <ButtButtson> To be fair Joker was a supremely stupid choice for smash
[12/10/18, 1:05:32 AM] <loohhoo> u almost made it too
[12/10/18, 1:05:32 AM] <Markass> slurpee is an undercover simpleflips viewer
[12/10/18, 1:05:33 AM] <loohhoo> darn
[12/10/18, 1:05:33 AM] <Armless_Steve> I had never heard of Geno until people started begging for him in Smash

[12/10/18, 1:05:54 AM] <pupsrus13> I just REALLY want Marina and Lunar from Mischief Makers in smash....
[12/10/18, 1:05:56 AM] <PepprCorn> I got cash on Minecraft Steve for smash tbh
[12/10/18, 1:05:57 AM] <theblj> I had never heard of Mario until people started complaining that he's not in Smash, very stupid choice either way
[12/10/18, 1:05:59 AM] <FrostDragonV22> I'm a good vip
[12/10/18, 1:05:59 AM] <terribleme36> Even tho Shovel Knights an assist trophy it would be cool to a actually play as him
[12/10/18, 1:05:59 AM] <ティオニシア> @GhostSonic a lot of promo stuff + the high success of Yacht Club Games pushed him into the spotlight
[12/10/18, 1:06:01 AM] <FrostDragonV22> MiniK
[12/10/18, 1:06:05 AM] <davidik400> oh... legit speedrun time I see...

[12/10/18, 1:06:05 AM] <Little_Tub> Ace and Slurpee remind me of Palkia and Dialga
[12/10/18, 1:06:06 AM] <Farathil_> @GhostSonic I think it's due to his success even though it was a kickstarter. Most indie kickstarters aren't successful
[12/10/18, 1:06:17 AM] <jayttt> LUL
[12/10/18, 1:06:20 AM] <Radriant> @buffalosunking you where a stupid choice form your parents

[12/10/18, 1:06:35 AM] <T_Dangles> These guys do a channel plug at the end of the video if you wanna skip that FYI @SimpleFlips
[12/10/18, 1:06:37 AM] <ButtButtson> @cephalosapien Yeh but if we're going that route then we can pretty much put anyone who's even slightly related to Nintendo in
[12/10/18, 1:06:37 AM] <SilentTao> Ed Edd n' Eddy is the first trio character for smash
[12/10/18, 1:06:38 AM] <jayttt> Dialga > Palkia @Little_Tub

[12/10/18, 1:06:50 AM] <PiManAndTheIrrationals> Shovel Knight was just a solid game.
[12/10/18, 1:06:51 AM] <farukdede12556> hhhh
[12/10/18, 1:06:51 AM] <nachoborracho1188> I love when I find hidden cookies that my wife made and didn’t tell me about
[12/10/18, 1:06:52 AM] <MirorT> yes I can believe that
[12/10/18, 1:06:52 AM] <GhostSonic> Considering Sans literally doesn't want to fight 98% of the time, yes @Armless_Steve
[12/10/18, 1:06:53 AM] <PAK215> @SilentTao What about Pokemon trainer?
[12/10/18, 1:06:55 AM] <dRmRcOOL> sans undertale is ness earthbound echo fighter

[12/10/18, 1:07:15 AM] <ButtButtson> I'm just saying that instead of Geno, Banjo or any of the highly requested characters, they decided "for the First DLC let's do Joker". DLC 3 or 4 that would be fine, but for the first? Dumbdumbs
[12/10/18, 1:07:16 AM] <Armless_Steve> @GhostSonic That is my ENTIRE point
[12/10/18, 1:07:17 AM] <CHAOS_FANTAZY> Isabelle is out for BLOOD, dude.
[12/10/18, 1:07:20 AM] <Baseball1043> SMG4 for smash?
[12/10/18, 1:07:23 AM] <terribleme36> I meant fair
[12/10/18, 1:07:27 AM] <jayttt> ??????????
[12/10/18, 1:07:28 AM] <Little_Tub> no you @ButtButtson
[12/10/18, 1:07:28 AM] <SilentTao> @PAK215 forgot about duck hunt.
[12/10/18, 1:07:30 AM] <GhostSonic> When I played New Leaf Isabelle wanted to kick my ass every single day dude
[12/10/18, 1:07:30 AM] <ティオニシア> if i am imagining the sexoskeleton joke i have officially lost my mind
[12/10/18, 1:07:33 AM] <Kratok> @SimpleFlips isabelle is a bloodthirsty dog
[12/10/18, 1:07:36 AM] <Archibaldthered> I think they should add dark souls from the hit video game, dark souls
[12/10/18, 1:07:38 AM] <blackston221221> it has a thousand legs and is made of solid steel
[12/10/18, 1:07:38 AM] <Iinneus> who played the griefer
[12/10/18, 1:07:39 AM] <ティオニシア> cause i am CONVINCED it was in a gex game
[12/10/18, 1:07:41 AM] <foxyshibata> I think you underestimate how popular persona is in japan
[12/10/18, 1:07:41 AM] <PiManAndTheIrrationals> I think the internet overrates how much people want Geno and Banjo tbh.
[12/10/18, 1:07:42 AM] <Evan1205gamin> Green fat Mario For Smash
[12/10/18, 1:07:44 AM] <L33monade> are you saying shes forced to fight? D:

[12/10/18, 1:07:47 AM] <loohhoo> punch cancel?
[12/10/18, 1:07:50 AM] <ButtButtson> @Little_Tub reported for trolling me to tears
[12/10/18, 1:07:52 AM] <Play3rNERD> How do you punch cancel?
[12/10/18, 1:07:53 AM] <loohhoo> is that why I keep hearing but not seeing punches
[12/10/18, 1:07:54 AM] <theshoover> PunchTrees
[12/10/18, 1:07:57 AM] <T_Dangles> Cunch pancel?
[12/10/18, 1:07:58 AM] <Foxen> you punch and then cancel it
[12/10/18, 1:07:59 AM] <Farathil_> @ButtButtson It was probs a business decision.
[12/10/18, 1:08:01 AM] <GhostSonic> Isabelle was constantly starting the game with "you wanna throw hands fucker?"
[12/10/18, 1:08:07 AM] <Play3rNERD> oof
[12/10/18, 1:08:10 AM] <PAK215> Isabelle is the least capable fighter in Smash, based on their own series'' lore
[12/10/18, 1:08:11 AM] <loohhoo> oh wow
[12/10/18, 1:08:15 AM] <loohhoo> I didn't know about that either uwu
[12/10/18, 1:08:16 AM] <GhostSonic> I couldn't believe she would say the f word either
[12/10/18, 1:08:21 AM] <Music_Matters_OK> Plot twist Mario is a pyramid
[12/10/18, 1:08:21 AM] <Armless_Steve> @PiManAndTheIrrationals I'd bet Banjo has actual high demand, but Geno I can't imagine being anything but a vocal minority
[12/10/18, 1:08:21 AM] <Moobot> Discord Server. All people welcome: http://discord.gg/simpleflips
[12/10/18, 1:08:22 AM] <ティオニシア> also persona Q 2 came out like, a week before the joker announcement
[12/10/18, 1:08:22 AM] <Markass> simple does that all the time
[12/10/18, 1:08:26 AM] <Little_Tub> that magneton just punch cancelled for you
[12/10/18, 1:08:26 AM] <dlivie1> no one knows punch cancel
[12/10/18, 1:08:30 AM] <ティオニシア> the first one was a big system pusher in japan
[12/10/18, 1:08:33 AM] <asandwichvsafish> you do it by cancelling your punch
[12/10/18, 1:08:35 AM] <ButtButtson> @Farathil_ I agree, it's just sad to see that the Smash DLC is not gonna be for wanted characters, but just Corrin-tier marketing decisions
[12/10/18, 1:08:37 AM] <PiManAndTheIrrationals> Yeah, I'm probably wrong on Banjo @Armless_Steve
[12/10/18, 1:08:37 AM] <dlivie1> simpleflips discovered it and never showed anyone
[12/10/18, 1:08:37 AM] <Play3rNERD> wow thanks for the speedrun tricks
[12/10/18, 1:08:40 AM] <dlivie1> until now
[12/10/18, 1:08:42 AM] <Rabrad27> Sometimes I feel bad about punching a small overworked dog.
[12/10/18, 1:08:43 AM] <Armless_Steve> I'm kind of surprised Rayman didn't get in, considering the whole Mario+Rabbids thing
[12/10/18, 1:08:44 AM] <FrostDragonV22> when is next SM74 EE vid
[12/10/18, 1:08:46 AM] <Baseball1043> that joker announcement was insane
[12/10/18, 1:08:51 AM] <T_Dangles> @FrostDragonV22 pls
[12/10/18, 1:08:52 AM] <foxyshibata> my personal predictions are
[12/10/18, 1:08:56 AM] <PepprCorn> I think isabelle is the type to wait until no one is around to start cursing up a storm
[12/10/18, 1:09:01 AM] <FrostDragonV22> @T_Dangles ?
[12/10/18, 1:09:11 AM] <sparn> anyhow goku for sure now
[12/10/18, 1:09:11 AM] <ティオニシア> i'm still predicting another FE character cause god does FEH make a lot of money.
[12/10/18, 1:09:14 AM] <terribleme36> @armless_steve There are still 4 more DLC spots tho
[12/10/18, 1:09:14 AM] <MirorT> the joker announcement didnt make sense to me. obviously Persona is huge but why add him to smash
[12/10/18, 1:09:15 AM] <T_Dangles> I want it too lol
[12/10/18, 1:09:15 AM] <Armless_Steve> Isabelle should have been an echo
[12/10/18, 1:09:23 AM] <theshoover> y
[12/10/18, 1:09:26 AM] <pupsrus13> Tox'd
[12/10/18, 1:09:27 AM] <Play3rNERD> f
[12/10/18, 1:09:27 AM] <PAK215> I still hold out hope for Monster Hunter
[12/10/18, 1:09:27 AM] <loohhoo> z
[12/10/18, 1:09:27 AM] <otterfiend> f
[12/10/18, 1:09:32 AM] <proZachGame> some might say she is lulWut
[12/10/18, 1:09:33 AM] <cephalosapien> Because Japan does collabs in games all the time.
[12/10/18, 1:09:33 AM] <ButtButtson> Consider that on release, Smash Ultimate only really has 6 new characters and 5 clones
[12/10/18, 1:09:33 AM] <MystycCheez> x
[12/10/18, 1:09:33 AM] <ublademan> Y
[12/10/18, 1:09:34 AM] <Markass> I'
[12/10/18, 1:09:35 AM] <dlivie1> why not
[12/10/18, 1:09:35 AM] <GhostSonic> @MirorT Because Persona is huge
[12/10/18, 1:09:36 AM] <FrostDragonV22> F
[12/10/18, 1:09:37 AM] <Farathil_> @ButtButtson I give them a pass for it look at the other characters the've already done this time.
[12/10/18, 1:09:37 AM] <HamStarred> y

[12/10/18, 1:09:43 AM] <T_Dangles> G
[12/10/18, 1:09:49 AM] <WolfsbaneGL> Persona 5? More like, Fursona 5, amirite?
[12/10/18, 1:09:49 AM] <MirorT> @ghostsonic whoa thats a good point
[12/10/18, 1:09:49 AM] <Rabrad27> She's the Luigi to Villager's Mario
[12/10/18, 1:09:50 AM] <McCannon> W
[12/10/18, 1:09:51 AM] <Iinneus> you were literally at vesting's last stream @SimpleFlips did you just avert your eyes
[12/10/18, 1:09:52 AM] <Sakkyoku> p5 > m64
[12/10/18, 1:09:52 AM] <PiManAndTheIrrationals> We also have to remember that Japan is typically what Smash will try to appeal to.
[12/10/18, 1:09:52 AM] <Markass> i've never seen vesting cry to person in my life or anything else that could happen
[12/10/18, 1:09:57 AM] <Foxen> Persona is sick and Joker is a great character that I never knew I wanted
[12/10/18, 1:09:58 AM] <PepprCorn> @mirort cause nintendo can. Thats why
[12/10/18, 1:10:00 AM] <GhostSonic> I'm hoping they're gonna port Persona 5 to Switch now, I'm surprised they didn't even allude to something like that
[12/10/18, 1:10:02 AM] <foxyshibata> Medusa from Kid Icarus, Shantae, and Baloon Fighter are my predictions.
[12/10/18, 1:10:04 AM] <terribleme36> @armless_steve I honestly have no idea
[12/10/18, 1:10:09 AM] <Little_Tub> @Markass what
[12/10/18, 1:10:11 AM] <MirorT> @pepprcorn yeah that's fair
[12/10/18, 1:10:11 AM] <Moobot> Follow me on Twitter so I can feel cool. I follow back names that are familiar. http://twitter.com/simpleflips
[12/10/18, 1:10:12 AM] <ButtButtson> @Farathil_ Echoes don't count, they're just slightly more different palette-swaps
[12/10/18, 1:10:13 AM] <foxyshibata> I feel Medusa's almost a garuntee.
[12/10/18, 1:10:13 AM] <Markass> I'd really like persona 5 on switch
[12/10/18, 1:10:14 AM] <Spinner_Of_Leeks> I know literally nothing about persona 5 but I am hyped just because everyone else is so happy
[12/10/18, 1:10:18 AM] <T_Dangles> @GhostSonic I would play the SHIT out of that
[12/10/18, 1:10:21 AM] <PikminWarrior> I'd like Impa
[12/10/18, 1:10:21 AM] <ButtButtson> Foxen likes Joker, confirmed DOOFUS
[12/10/18, 1:10:23 AM] <Iinneus> @Spinner_Of_Leeks Same here!
[12/10/18, 1:10:23 AM] <Spinner_Of_Leeks> if it comes to switch I'll get it
[12/10/18, 1:10:34 AM] <PikminWarrior> either her Skyward Sword or Hyrule Warriors appearance
[12/10/18, 1:10:38 AM] <ティオニシア> @Markass i think thats a real possibility in the future after PQ2's current success
[12/10/18, 1:10:39 AM] <Iinneus> @ButtButtson Tell us YOUR most wanted character.
[12/10/18, 1:10:41 AM] <foxyshibata> Sakurai really loves Kid Icarus, and every other series has their main viilian in smash.
[12/10/18, 1:10:46 AM] <GhostSonic> Yeah I don't own a PS4 so if it comes to PS4 it's a quick buy
[12/10/18, 1:10:51 AM] <dlivie1> if i ever attempted kiazo mario, i would most likely never complete it
[12/10/18, 1:10:53 AM] <GhostSonic> I mean if it comes to Switch
[12/10/18, 1:10:53 AM] <foxyshibata> But! I must reiterate.
[12/10/18, 1:10:55 AM] <GhostSonic> Whoop
[12/10/18, 1:10:55 AM] <sparn> P3 and P4 both got handheld versions I suppose, wouldn't be TOO weird if P5 got a switch port
[12/10/18, 1:10:58 AM] <mboy2000> L O R E
[12/10/18, 1:11:03 AM] <foxyshibata> that if the groose ain't loose we must vamoose!
[12/10/18, 1:11:05 AM] <Armless_Steve> How would chat feel about Lara Croft in smash?
[12/10/18, 1:11:13 AM] <FrostDragonV22> no
[12/10/18, 1:11:14 AM] <Foxen> I want KK Slider
[12/10/18, 1:11:15 AM] <Spinner_Of_Leeks> only original lara croft
[12/10/18, 1:11:16 AM] <ティオニシア> Atlus has a really strange way of working with nintendo
[12/10/18, 1:11:18 AM] <Farathil_> @ButtButtson I was talking more about Belmont, Piranha, K Rool, etc.
[12/10/18, 1:11:24 AM] <Markass> all I want is chibi robo dude :(
[12/10/18, 1:11:27 AM] <PAK215> @Armless_Steve Has Lara Croft ever appeared on a Nintendo console?
[12/10/18, 1:11:30 AM] <CHAOS_FANTAZY> If Groose couldn't make playable in Skyward Sword, he has NO CHANCE of being in Smash.
[12/10/18, 1:11:39 AM] <Armless_Steve> @PAK215 Has Joker?
[12/10/18, 1:11:40 AM] <PiManAndTheIrrationals> I wouldn't mind myself. Characters that are icons of the gaming industry like Master Chief and Lara would be pretty neat to see in Smash
[12/10/18, 1:11:43 AM] <MirorT> I still want waluigi just because I think itd be funny
[12/10/18, 1:11:43 AM] <PikminWarrior> Groose is playable in a few seconds
[12/10/18, 1:11:48 AM] <Alch505> Eh I wouldn't be opposed to her but i wouldn't really be to excited personally
[12/10/18, 1:11:49 AM] <scrubfeg> I want simpleflips in smash
[12/10/18, 1:11:49 AM] <PAK215> @Armless_Steve I've heard that he has
[12/10/18, 1:11:50 AM] <CHAOS_FANTAZY> ...Er, not Skyward Sword, Hyrule Warriors.
[12/10/18, 1:11:50 AM] <umgrlk> BUP in smash
[12/10/18, 1:11:52 AM] <BetaSigmaOmega> please add Flint from Mother 3 to smash

[12/10/18, 1:11:53 AM] <Farathil_> @PAK215 Do you count DS?
[12/10/18, 1:11:53 AM] <ButtButtson> @Iinneus Quite genuinely I want Majora/Skull kid

[12/10/18, 1:12:02 AM] <PAK215> @Farathil_ yes
[12/10/18, 1:12:03 AM] <T_Dangles> King Boo is the sleeper pick
[12/10/18, 1:12:04 AM] <Moobot> https://crowdmade.com/collections/simpleflips - Literally the highest quality merchandise providers available for content creators. You'll look incredible and be more comfortable than you could imagine.
[12/10/18, 1:12:04 AM] <PikminWarrior> but only when he's using the G R O O S E N A T O R
[12/10/18, 1:12:05 AM] <PepprCorn> I want to see gordon ramsay for smash
[12/10/18, 1:12:06 AM] <Trueballer21> honestly Chuckya for Smash
[12/10/18, 1:12:09 AM] <Iinneus> I'm hoping no more of my favorite characters get added to Smash...
[12/10/18, 1:12:09 AM] <Armless_Steve> @PAK215 All I know is she's Square Enix and they let them use Cloud so as far as I'm concerned, anything's possible
[12/10/18, 1:12:10 AM] <FrostDragonV22> mewtwo was a great smash character.
[12/10/18, 1:12:10 AM] <ButtButtson> Zelda deserves another rep that isn't another Link clone
[12/10/18, 1:12:11 AM] <Trueballer21> grab OP

[12/10/18, 1:12:16 AM] <Kratok> Geno is a dead character LUL
[12/10/18, 1:12:17 AM] <ティオニシア> Geno's cool, but think about this: Mallow
[12/10/18, 1:12:18 AM] <MtnDont1298> Foxen got an offer to be in smash
[12/10/18, 1:12:20 AM] <secret_tsukasa> Better than having him in office
[12/10/18, 1:12:22 AM] <Farathil_> Skull kid would be awesome for smash imo.
[12/10/18, 1:12:25 AM] <CHAOS_FANTAZY> @SimpleFlips I thought you said you wanted Ashley at some point?
[12/10/18, 1:12:25 AM] <Play3rNERD> still waiting for that bub costume for toad
[12/10/18, 1:12:29 AM] <zant5976> I am positive that Monster Hunter will be part of the game if Rathalos is a boss.
[12/10/18, 1:12:29 AM] <Markass> lmao
[12/10/18, 1:12:32 AM] <ティオニシア> Foxen's invite got stolen by Joker
[12/10/18, 1:12:33 AM] <T_Dangles> Lmao

[12/10/18, 1:12:45 AM] <kman224> I can't believe fox isn't actually a charecter in smash
[12/10/18, 1:12:46 AM] <Scrotumless> WF when
[12/10/18, 1:12:49 AM] <meanmugdoug> buzz buzz should be a character
[12/10/18, 1:12:51 AM] <1sme> literally every character has a spirit rofl
[12/10/18, 1:12:53 AM] <Foxen> whose invite DID Joker steal lmao
[12/10/18, 1:12:58 AM] <ButtButtson> It just really hurts that instead of Skull Kid or other Nintendo reps, we got Joker. And the hinted that most of the DLC will be third-party, so my dreams are dead
[12/10/18, 1:12:58 AM] <Farathil_> What I really want is some sort of Waddle Dee or Doo for a Kirby echo.
[12/10/18, 1:12:58 AM] <proZachGame> balance board for smash
[12/10/18, 1:12:58 AM] <Althor> Mine
[12/10/18, 1:13:00 AM] <PAK215> Monster Hunter seems like a pretty good choice, given that its Capcom's biggest franchise
[12/10/18, 1:13:01 AM] <TornadoBrahmin> He stole Gokus
[12/10/18, 1:13:01 AM] <GhostSonic> Klanoa for

[12/10/18, 1:13:22 AM] <CHAOS_FANTAZY> Klonoa's pretty neat. I don't see the moveset potential, but I do like him.
[12/10/18, 1:13:27 AM] <Markass> when are they adding nintendog as a character
[12/10/18, 1:13:28 AM] <1sme> imagine commentary over a sans ditto
[12/10/18, 1:13:29 AM] <ButtButtson> Monster Hunter i don't want because Capcom would get money and I want Capcom to not get money because I hate them
[12/10/18, 1:13:30 AM] <MirorT> BRING ME MACHO GRUBBA
[12/10/18, 1:13:35 AM] <RoxieMika> klonoa would be like out of left field and a 3rd party rep

[12/10/18, 1:13:48 AM] <bIuevoid> put luigi in smash
[12/10/18, 1:13:48 AM] <foxyshibata> I'd be okay with Medusa. But honestly I'd be most hype for a new F-Zero charecter
[12/10/18, 1:13:51 AM] <dlivie1> if simpleflips was the last great entertainer on this planet, i'd be ok with that /dab
[12/10/18, 1:13:56 AM] <Baseball1043> yoshi riding yoshi
[12/10/18, 1:13:56 AM] <GhostSonic> Yoshi would never be in smash lmao

[12/10/18, 1:14:02 AM] <BroShock_> I want mario screaming in smash, The youtube video itself as a character
[12/10/18, 1:14:04 AM] <Armless_Steve> I would love to see the Doom Slayer in Smash because I'm pretty sure Doom Eternal is coming to Switch, but I have no idea how they would make that work
[12/10/18, 1:14:09 AM] <Brian_B_> i wish yoshi was in smash :[
[12/10/18, 1:14:11 AM] <ティオニシア> it's mainly cause i'm a huge lesbian for medusa, but i digress.
[12/10/18, 1:14:14 AM] <proZachGame> >a side character that mario rides in smash LUL
[12/10/18, 1:14:16 AM] <foxyshibata> D O O M G U Y W H E N

[12/10/18, 1:14:19 AM] <linkthesilver> 2-D Yoshi for Smash
[12/10/18, 1:14:20 AM] <meanmugdoug> kreygO

[12/10/18, 1:14:23 AM] <CHAOS_FANTAZY> @TornadoBrahmin And that's why I didn't say "no moveset potential," only that I don't see it. I just don't know Klonoa that well.
[12/10/18, 1:14:26 AM] <theblj> Pretty weird they put in Godzilla before Yoshi tbqh
[12/10/18, 1:14:26 AM] <umgrlk> i wanted mario for smash :(
[12/10/18, 1:14:28 AM] <Iinneus> I want someone to make a list of reasons why every character who is currently in Smash aside from, like, Mario, has no chance of appearing in Smash.
[12/10/18, 1:14:32 AM] <foxyshibata> Bro same Medusa is a certain spice that delights the seven senses
[12/10/18, 1:14:32 AM] <ButtButtson> @PAK215 Just because people are willing to put up with anti-consumer Capcom now, doesn't mean forever. Maybe one day they'll go bankrupt and their IPs can be bought by better companies
[12/10/18, 1:14:33 AM] <aGlitchh> @foxyshibata doom slayer would be awesome
[12/10/18, 1:14:34 AM] <PepprCorn> Doomguy would be dope
[12/10/18, 1:14:34 AM] <brycenbeanz1> put mike tyson from punch-out in smash
[12/10/18, 1:14:35 AM] <Markass> I want chibi robo because then people would like chibi robo and they'd make a proper sequel
[12/10/18, 1:14:35 AM] <L33monade> they should put another 5 links in smash to make a chain
[12/10/18, 1:14:37 AM] <cephalosapien> I just bought second and third copies of my Capcom games to make up for Butts' lack of purchases
[12/10/18, 1:14:41 AM] <Play3rNERD> @linkthesilver that would be a good costume
[12/10/18, 1:14:42 AM] <Foxen> Joker stole Waluigi's invite
[12/10/18, 1:14:45 AM] <PikminWarrior> can you don't
[12/10/18, 1:14:51 AM] <GhostSonic> I feel like Nintendo would shy away from Doom just because it's a lot more violent than any other franchise in Smash
[12/10/18, 1:14:54 AM] <ティオニシア> Chibi robo would be adorable
[12/10/18, 1:14:54 AM] <jgeodude_> rooAww
[12/10/18, 1:14:56 AM] <TornadoBrahmin> Joker stole Goku's invite
[12/10/18, 1:15:01 AM] <proZachGame> itd be pretty cool if they put king kong in smash, for other people to ride him
[12/10/18, 1:15:01 AM] <ButtButtson> @cephalosapien I just cried reading this why are you hurting me I don't like it
[12/10/18, 1:15:02 AM] <T_Dangles> When is Joker
[12/10/18, 1:15:03 AM] <umgrlk> i want another fire emblem character with a sword Kappa
[12/10/18, 1:15:05 AM] <dlivie1> 69 coins, nice
[12/10/18, 1:15:07 AM] <linkthesilver> @play3rnerd that’d be awesome
[12/10/18, 1:15:13 AM] <GhostSonic> I think Joker in Smash pacified vesting for life tbh
[12/10/18, 1:15:17 AM] <CHAOS_FANTAZY> @Markass Yeah, Smash is sure to boost popularity. Just look how that panned out for Captain Falc--oh, wait...
[12/10/18, 1:15:17 AM] <MirorT> @buttbuttson why do you dislike capcom
[12/10/18, 1:15:20 AM] <Markass> bayo is kinda violent no?
[12/10/18, 1:15:26 AM] <FrostDragonV22> vesting eats poop?
[12/10/18, 1:15:28 AM] <T_Dangles> only a liiiiiiiiiiiiitle
[12/10/18, 1:15:30 AM] <Armless_Steve> @GhostSonic That's my bet, wishful thinking though
[12/10/18, 1:15:32 AM] <pestypig> Wow alot of viewers this evening
[12/10/18, 1:15:35 AM] <GhostSonic> Bayonetta isn't super bloody or anything
[12/10/18, 1:15:36 AM] <sparn> bayo is very violent but it's easier to avoid that in a game like smash
[12/10/18, 1:15:36 AM] <MirorT> can they add Guile? my favorite street fighter character
[12/10/18, 1:15:36 AM] <PepprCorn> @ghostsonic bro they dropped nukes in metal gear. I feel like doom is tame to that
[12/10/18, 1:15:37 AM] <Kickalicious> fuckin G R A P E S
[12/10/18, 1:15:38 AM] <ティオニシア> bayo's violence is a bit more..comic-y? it's less raw
[12/10/18, 1:15:38 AM] <BenBenBenBenBenBenBenB> They did surgery on a chuckya
[12/10/18, 1:15:40 AM] <scrubfeg> Lets be honest we NEED another pokemon

[12/10/18, 1:15:42 AM] <asandwichvsafish> grapes for smash
[12/10/18, 1:15:46 AM] <Armless_Steve> Bayo is violent, but not DOOM violent
[12/10/18, 1:15:48 AM] <Godric16> theyre just getting back at you from doing surgery on them
[12/10/18, 1:15:49 AM] <otterfiend> loocifer
[12/10/18, 1:15:51 AM] <C641076> You've been watching too much AttackingTucans if you're calling those things grapes

[12/10/18, 1:15:54 AM] <L33monade> since they put joker in smash i think they should put batman as well Kappa
[12/10/18, 1:15:58 AM] <BroShock_> Nice 103 coin route
[12/10/18, 1:15:59 AM] <FrostDragonV22> doom is amazing
[12/10/18, 1:16:04 AM] <Armless_Steve> @scrubfeg you mean Fire Emblem character
[12/10/18, 1:16:04 AM] <Rabrad27> Advent Children Cloud as an echo fighter.
[12/10/18, 1:16:04 AM] <FrostDragonV22> I love doom
[12/10/18, 1:16:05 AM] <PikminWarrior> Bayonetta is also super sexual though
[12/10/18, 1:16:05 AM] <worldoftanks_110> wtf ?you not s1mple
[12/10/18, 1:16:08 AM] <foxyshibata> gamers rise up
[12/10/18, 1:16:09 AM] <Lumberman143> Just build ive seen joel do it
[12/10/18, 1:16:09 AM] <sparn> the most violent things in bayonetta are mostly executions/finishers for bosses
[12/10/18, 1:16:11 AM] <kiddvenison> do you ever get tired of sm64?
[12/10/18, 1:16:14 AM] <ButtButtson> @MirorT My favorite game series are DMC, Dead Rising and Monster Hunter. They ruined the first 2, and the 3rd one went in a direction I don't like
[12/10/18, 1:16:15 AM] <Play3rNERD> G R A P E S
[12/10/18, 1:16:15 AM] <Markass> kirby is violent
[12/10/18, 1:16:15 AM] <Armless_Steve> Someone ban this guy @L33monade
[12/10/18, 1:16:16 AM] <MirelurkPatties> ridley's final smash should've been his cutscene from MoM
[12/10/18, 1:16:16 AM] <cephalosapien> did mario just cancel the shy guy's fire by breakdancing?
[12/10/18, 1:16:16 AM] <PAK215> They should add Bartman to smash, tbh
[12/10/18, 1:16:18 AM] <MirorT> I want macho grubba or Guile
[12/10/18, 1:16:20 AM] <umgrlk> i want dad for smash
[12/10/18, 1:16:24 AM] <jayttt> They did surgery on a grape @SimpleFlips
[12/10/18, 1:16:29 AM] <Armless_Steve> imagine Dante in smash
[12/10/18, 1:16:32 AM] <Armless_Steve> it could happen
[12/10/18, 1:16:35 AM] <MirorT> @buttbuttson didn't like mh World? I did
[12/10/18, 1:16:37 AM] <Godric16> i just assumed a man with 200 IQ would have that title under his belt
[12/10/18, 1:16:42 AM] <ティオニシア> everyone considering the MH protag for smash, consider this: Guildmarm
[12/10/18, 1:16:43 AM] <Foxen> Robotnik could be cool
[12/10/18, 1:16:44 AM] <BroShock_> I want ken in smash. The guy who the ken combo is named after

[12/10/18, 1:16:50 AM] <MtnDont1298> They need to add the ear destroying note hour long note so it can smash my ear drums
[12/10/18, 1:16:51 AM] <otterfiend> grape in smash
[12/10/18, 1:16:52 AM] <Kickalicious> they graped a surgery?
[12/10/18, 1:16:53 AM] <Archibaldthered> theydidsurgeryonagrapetheydidsurgeryonagrapetheydidsurgeryonagrapetheydidsurgeryonagrapetheydidsurgeryonagrape
[12/10/18, 1:16:54 AM] <theblj> A grape did a sugery on them
[12/10/18, 1:16:54 AM] <PikminWarrior> Grapes are named after the sound they make when they fall off the vine
[12/10/18, 1:16:57 AM] <PAK215> Grapes are a lot like eyes, so they're perfect targets for surgery
[12/10/18, 1:16:58 AM] <authorblues> they did plastic surgery on a raisin
[12/10/18, 1:16:59 AM] <worldoftanks_110> идите нахуй
[12/10/18, 1:17:02 AM] <Armless_Steve> @Foxen I was really hoping to see another Sonic rep, Eggman would be rad as fuck
[12/10/18, 1:17:02 AM] <jayttt> They should add the joke of bart simpson to smash

[12/10/18, 1:17:04 AM] <FrostDragonV22> they did surgery on a human @SimpleFlips

[12/10/18, 1:17:05 AM] <SmugFug> grape is my main
[12/10/18, 1:17:11 AM] <ZPScissors> the surgery on a grape video is like 10 years old and it's just now become something people know about
[12/10/18, 1:17:14 AM] <cephalosapien> I don't like MHW either. I love it.
[12/10/18, 1:17:21 AM] <GhostSonic> They did a lobotomy on a cactus

[12/10/18, 1:17:33 AM] <MirorT> @simpleflips the grape surgery thing was a test to see if they could perform micro surgery no joke
[12/10/18, 1:17:36 AM] <umgrlk> when surgery on a watermelon
[12/10/18, 1:17:39 AM] <FrostDragonV22> @GhostSonic that one was actually funny
[12/10/18, 1:17:40 AM] <Murples_> they did surgery on a fermented grape and thats how wine was made
[12/10/18, 1:17:41 AM] <cephalosapien> @mashhhr 360
[12/10/18, 1:17:42 AM] <T_Dangles> Cacti brains are tiny damn i'm impressed
[12/10/18, 1:17:45 AM] <Markass> I already have amiibo for boo chibi robo and waddle dee so they could just add those
[12/10/18, 1:17:49 AM] <kman224> they gave electroshock therapy to a watermellon
[12/10/18, 1:17:50 AM] <zee_tee_> raisins are just grape outpatients
[12/10/18, 1:17:51 AM] <ButtButtson> @MirorT Nah the openness was a bad choice IMO, and it felt too easy. Plus theyh promised a lot of content updates and didn't deliver, no G-rank or nothing
[12/10/18, 1:17:51 AM] <Ryartran> they did a colonoscopy on a ficus
[12/10/18, 1:17:52 AM] <MtnDont1298> They gave a tumor to a berry

[12/10/18, 1:18:08 AM] <ティオニシア> imagine if they put Marx in smash lol
[12/10/18, 1:18:10 AM] <PikminWarrior> the first grape was discovered when a scientist tried to deconstruct grape juice
[12/10/18, 1:18:19 AM] <HamStarred> whomps
[12/10/18, 1:18:19 AM] <MirorT> @buttbuttson those are very very fair criticisms but i enjoyed the game nonetheless

[12/10/18, 1:18:52 AM] <GhostSonic> They were about to do life saving surgery but I saw grapes on the operating table and I just couldn't trust them
[12/10/18, 1:18:55 AM] <Farathil_> Can anyone confirm that Dedede got buffed in this smash for me?
[12/10/18, 1:18:56 AM] <cephalosapien> this better be the Luke Saward version

[12/10/18, 1:19:27 AM] <ButtButtson> @MirorT I don't think it's a bad game, it's just they went a direction I didn't enjoy. Dead Rising on the other hand, they went a direction that was objectively trash and I'll never forgive them
[12/10/18, 1:19:28 AM] <MirorT> does anyone know if Ike is better in Smash ultimate?
[12/10/18, 1:19:28 AM] <ティオニシア> he's like mid tier

[12/10/18, 1:21:15 AM] <Grandysong> What game are you playing tomorrow?
[12/10/18, 1:21:17 AM] <GhostSonic> I thought you were talking about the Joel smash thing
[12/10/18, 1:21:17 AM] <GhostSonic> What
[12/10/18, 1:21:19 AM] <loohhoo> 120 @justnoum
[12/10/18, 1:21:20 AM] <foxyshibata> so what's less fun, this or chaos?
[12/10/18, 1:21:20 AM] <justnoum> oh k
[12/10/18, 1:21:21 AM] <stebiewonder> ready to smash ;v
[12/10/18, 1:21:22 AM] <T_Dangles> I'm surprised your hand hurts though, wasn't too stressful for me
[12/10/18, 1:21:33 AM] <AngelSassinTV> big ol long smash thing :lennyface:
[12/10/18, 1:21:35 AM] <PepprCorn> @buttbuttson Hard agree, but I thought 3 was ok
[12/10/18, 1:21:37 AM] <cephalosapien> shesez is the homie
[12/10/18, 1:21:41 AM] <umgrlk> smesh
[12/10/18, 1:21:45 AM] <PiManAndTheIrrationals> I remember hearing about Boundary Break from him when he posted on GameFAQs a lot in the early days.
[12/10/18, 1:21:46 AM] <Iinneus> @justnoum You can usually find that answer in the stream title!
[12/10/18, 1:21:46 AM] <umgrlk> this
[12/10/18, 1:21:48 AM] <PAK215> My Smash thing is pretty big and long
[12/10/18, 1:21:49 AM] <LucidAtray1> shesez is cute af
[12/10/18, 1:21:53 AM] <justnoum> Who else is trying Jiggs?
[12/10/18, 1:22:09 AM] <FrostDragonV22> I like this more than chaos
[12/10/18, 1:22:10 AM] <Moobot> If you play RuneScape, join cc Simpuru if you want to hang out while I play. Luv u idiot
[12/10/18, 1:22:16 AM] <foxyshibata> in 'kaizo' romhacks it's always really dissapointing the number of things that are...exactly the same
[12/10/18, 1:22:16 AM] <ButtButtson> @terribleme36 Exactly, the simplicity without combo weapons is best
[12/10/18, 1:22:17 AM] <apiossj> it’s more my arm muscles from moving back and forth so fast haha
[12/10/18, 1:22:22 AM] <scrubfeg> buwdbaiudwabvi
[12/10/18, 1:22:23 AM] <foxyshibata> it just dissapoints you
[12/10/18, 1:22:24 AM] <Truman> im trying jiggs but she's almost as bad as she was in smash 4
[12/10/18, 1:22:26 AM] <AppleFritter93> chaos is more fun cuz of the random crap that can happen
[12/10/18, 1:22:32 AM] <umgrlk> *fast typing*
[12/10/18, 1:22:34 AM] <PiManAndTheIrrationals> Boundary Break is so cool.
[12/10/18, 1:22:34 AM] <BacklashShadow> YOOOO front page simple!
[12/10/18, 1:22:40 AM] <T_Dangles> are you playing it too fast
[12/10/18, 1:22:42 AM] <PikminWarrior> I like Zelda a lot in ultimate
[12/10/18, 1:22:43 AM] <maggi_soup> :O
[12/10/18, 1:22:45 AM] <AkaneAM1102> Wdym Jiggs is better now
[12/10/18, 1:22:47 AM] <Ebbsbenedict> i have never heard a mans fingers type so fast
[12/10/18, 1:22:51 AM] <T_Dangles> everyone plays it too fast
[12/10/18, 1:22:52 AM] <secret_tsukasa> Is this supposed to be kaizo? It looks easy
[12/10/18, 1:22:53 AM] <MhmThatHappened> he typed: cycifig6sodcivycuxufdctxobucmjk ovugrxogac ovtvocuvucpyff
[12/10/18, 1:22:54 AM] <jayttt> LUL
[12/10/18, 1:22:56 AM] <laborwavee> the video from simple flips im waiting for is his setup tour
[12/10/18, 1:22:58 AM] <ButtButtson> @PepprCorn 3 didn't have the spirit I feel. The zombies were negligible because you always had god-weapons
[12/10/18, 1:22:59 AM] <Truman> i said almost as bad
[12/10/18, 1:22:59 AM] <Ebbsbenedict> toes* sorry forgot you dont have hands :(
[12/10/18, 1:23:00 AM] <mboy2000> rip box
[12/10/18, 1:23:02 AM] <Armless_Steve> When you lose in Chaos it's hard to get too frustrated because your death is almost never your own fault
[12/10/18, 1:23:03 AM] <Snapfighter> and WR for 120 star has passed
[12/10/18, 1:23:04 AM] <Truman> jiggs is better but still bad
[12/10/18, 1:23:06 AM] <apiossj> perhaps
[12/10/18, 1:23:10 AM] <Iinneus> @secret_tsukasa It's a very old romhack-- it's one of the earliest.
[12/10/18, 1:23:11 AM] <Manuel____> It is so weird to listen to normal in-game music on a SimpleFlips Stream.
[12/10/18, 1:23:16 AM] <PepprCorn> Is it true that falco is good now? I won't be getting ultimate till Christmas
[12/10/18, 1:23:16 AM] <Markass> lmao
[12/10/18, 1:23:16 AM] <Godric16> and i really really want to be with PPPPEAACH
[12/10/18, 1:23:21 AM] <indy> hello simpleflips
[12/10/18, 1:23:21 AM] <Godric16> the pwincess

[12/10/18, 1:23:27 AM] <Truman> hi jordan
[12/10/18, 1:23:28 AM] <justnoum> I'd say Jiggs got much better
[12/10/18, 1:23:29 AM] <T_Dangles> @PepprCorn only if you're a melee god
[12/10/18, 1:23:30 AM] <umgrlk> kaizo hacks are the father of mario maker troll levels
[12/10/18, 1:23:34 AM] <indy> yo what up Truman, my dude
[12/10/18, 1:23:36 AM] <AngelSassinTV> @Godric16 I'm already peach
[12/10/18, 1:23:37 AM] <Truman> nm nm
[12/10/18, 1:23:43 AM] <Alch505> Falco is really fun but I've had probs with jab
[12/10/18, 1:23:45 AM] <indy> yeah IndigoSwoon
[12/10/18, 1:23:46 AM] <justnoum> I mean up air to rest is a thing aparently
[12/10/18, 1:23:56 AM] <the_ultra_nerd> Did anyone see the hbox stream on day 1?
[12/10/18, 1:23:57 AM] <T_Dangles> up air to rest was a thing in s4 too
[12/10/18, 1:23:59 AM] <GhostSonic> I like how I was reading a bunch of people say "jiggs is good now" in another window, then I look back here and it's like "Jiggs actually sucks"
[12/10/18, 1:24:00 AM] <Truman> any character that dies as early as jiggs does in a game where half the cast can live forever will be bad
[12/10/18, 1:24:00 AM] <Godric16> @AngelSassinTV im already AngelSassinTV
[12/10/18, 1:24:04 AM] <AngelSassinTV> oh shoot
[12/10/18, 1:24:13 AM] <justnoum> chudat
[12/10/18, 1:24:16 AM] <terribleme36> @buttbuttson Yeah definitely because in one and two the zombies were big problems I always would find myself running at low health
[12/10/18, 1:24:18 AM] <Godric16> get oofed

[12/10/18, 1:24:25 AM] <justnoum> although it was worst in smash 4

[12/10/18, 1:25:06 AM] <ButtButtson> @terribleme36 I hate 4 the most just because I love Frank West and that game actively makes his character the worst

[12/10/18, 1:26:57 AM] <Godric16> @Foxen was this the game with a really annoying level you were complaining about like 2 days ago?
[12/10/18, 1:26:57 AM] <T_Dangles> Adds it into the equation I think
[12/10/18, 1:26:59 AM] <AngelSassinTV> prolly doing a 100%
[12/10/18, 1:27:02 AM] <Miamiandy513> maybe its a negative integer?

[12/10/18, 1:29:12 AM] <GhostSonic> That's not a half-hour interval
[12/10/18, 1:29:14 AM] <Markass> cheese sleeps in all the time for things anyway
[12/10/18, 1:29:17 AM] <jahikoi> I finally caught a SimpleFlips stream. He spent 3 and a half hours forgetting about Smash and then fell asleep live on stream. Great entertainer he is!
[12/10/18, 1:29:18 AM] <AngelSassinTV> Even if you start an hour late, you'll destroy them in the race
[12/10/18, 1:29:19 AM] <Little_Tub> Are you trying to plan things with like 400 people in europe
[12/10/18, 1:29:21 AM] <ティオニシア> there's no way cheese is getting there before 1 LOL
