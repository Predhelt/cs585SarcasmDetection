[09/15/18, 11:44:43 PM] <3ternals0ul> @ProtonJon There are some games where you play it to see how things get mixed up. Katamari is one of those games you play because you know what to expect, like Tetris or Picross.
[09/15/18, 11:44:43 PM] <JackTrevorXD> And Spiderman 2 is coming back being a mod choice
[09/15/18, 11:44:45 PM] <TygerTyger413> Yay Katamari :D

[09/15/18, 11:52:42 PM] <AtticusYK> @ProtonJon by that logic, the villains should be allowed to win because they're doing what they want
[09/15/18, 11:52:43 PM] <Cloud3514> The fact that they're putting the Lord of the Rings Living Card Game on Switch makes me want Asmodee to make a version of Legend of the Five Rings LCG for the Switch.

[09/16/18, 12:07:06 AM] <QueenOfGlitch> so the black hole is a katamari?
[09/16/18, 12:07:07 AM] <TheGTF> The one you are specifically describing Love Live the Queen though
[09/16/18, 12:07:08 AM] <caliatom> Dammit King, you are a goddamn fuckup

[09/16/18, 12:07:25 AM] <AceLucario> Oh yeah.
[09/16/18, 12:07:25 AM] <MrSkerpentine> EVERYTHING IS DEAD
[09/16/18, 12:07:26 AM] <AriZonia1> @ProtonJon he caused the problem
[09/16/18, 12:07:28 AM] <tidaltempest45> @ProtonJon Reminder the first game was caused because he was drunk off his ass
[09/16/18, 12:07:28 AM] <agentemerlad> The King broke the cosmos with a FUTURE TENNIS SLAM
[09/16/18, 12:07:28 AM] <MarisaKirisamethe2nd> LLTQ is the most well known one (and probably the best?)

[09/16/18, 12:07:33 AM] <BigDreGamer> @ProtonJon @Kuuribro @Myohel0 Yeah, the spreadsheet said Jon last played it on stream on December 1, 2013. Maybe you played it and you forgot to save?
[09/16/18, 12:07:33 AM] <Wandering_Spellsword> He literally just caused the problem!
[09/16/18, 12:07:34 AM] <flygon7889> Katamar
[09/16/18, 12:07:34 AM] <Courier_Dan> ...he DID cause the problem though!
[09/16/18, 12:07:35 AM] <Blue_Link13> Well, Jon, he created the Black Hole too
[09/16/18, 12:07:37 AM] <MagusAndrus> @ProtonJon I mean, he still CAUSED the Black Hole in the first place...
[09/16/18, 12:07:38 AM] <KinkyRay> UHHHHHH. the R word is a KEY WORD in the game tags for it
[09/16/18, 12:07:38 AM] <DarkestTempest> Except he kind of served the black hole up.
[09/16/18, 12:07:40 AM] <DremMemry> Daikon dill and cabbage!
[09/16/18, 12:07:42 AM] <RyuKageChroma> He caused the problem, but he also did something to slow the problem down.
[09/16/18, 12:07:42 AM] <SailorSylveonMoon> Im peetty aure He DID CAUSED THAT BLACK HOLE
[09/16/18, 12:07:43 AM] <pokemonfreak97> @ProtonJon he caused the problem in the cutscene you just watched
[09/16/18, 12:07:43 AM] <ZeoSigma> Didn't The King cause the black hole?
[09/16/18, 12:07:44 AM] <theredsamurai05> so hyped for the remake!!

[09/16/18, 12:07:57 AM] <Epiccraft9001> THE KING WASNT ALWAYS EVIL?
[09/16/18, 12:07:59 AM] <disgaea_demon_overlord> Yeah. That was the basic idea of the second game.
[09/16/18, 12:08:01 AM] <Linkhaxor> still speaking in records scratches I see
[09/16/18, 12:08:06 AM] <taganplaysstuff> So he caused the black hole, but also put a stopped to it? ... Neutral

[09/16/18, 12:12:39 AM] <CrazyGirlEspeon> Q fucks physics and science equivalently to king of all cosmos

[09/16/18, 12:12:45 AM] <Starboy35tcoos> When I hear of Q I think of SF3 Q
[09/16/18, 12:12:46 AM] <garland41> Q is the being that introduces them to the Borg
[09/16/18, 12:12:49 AM] <SabEric39> ROYAL RAINBOW PogChamp
[09/16/18, 12:12:51 AM] <BadRoad> Q appeared once per season. He's in the first episode.

[09/16/18, 12:19:00 AM] <citerel> I like the soundtrack more than the one on PSP
[09/16/18, 12:19:01 AM] <wootmasterzorsx> @thenegativepro Okay, let's be fair, video games are a bit more non-specific with regards to target audience. Like, nobody's gonna argue Mario's meant for kids or anything.
[09/16/18, 12:19:02 AM] <FusionFiction63> @JackTrevorXD In it?! He fucking produced it!
[09/16/18, 12:19:06 AM] <KritiKyle> yuuuuup
[09/16/18, 12:19:12 AM] <AmephEstMako> @JackTrevorXD Yeah...Discord is a rather important secondary character in the show
[09/16/18, 12:19:15 AM] <onestormymorning> yup
[09/16/18, 12:19:23 AM] <AtticusYK> I like to call it Toy Story 2 syndrome. The later ones are good, but not the level of the original.
[09/16/18, 12:19:33 AM] <Goldmemberpb> is the katamari remaster only for switch?
[09/16/18, 12:19:34 AM] <Epiccraft9001> Katamari for smash?
[09/16/18, 12:19:38 AM] <TheEmeraldBard> And then fans will complain because they think Namco is giving into its hardcore fanbase
[09/16/18, 12:19:38 AM] <JackTrevorXD> @FusionFiction63 Yeah, I know BUT IT'S AN AMAZING COENCIDENCE
[09/16/18, 12:19:41 AM] <onestormymorning> they're all so catcchy

[09/16/18, 12:19:46 AM] <JonathanGruver> The remaster is for Switch and Steam
[09/16/18, 12:19:49 AM] <DEB79ful> This reminds me of the second vocal song from Mario Odyssey.
[09/16/18, 12:19:51 AM] <Lookingforcake> I agree so much
[09/16/18, 12:19:55 AM] <Bronyraikou888> @kuuribro @myohel0 I personally think that Beautiful has one of the strongest soundtracks; VERY close to topping the original. Songs like Katamari Dancing, Guru Guru Gravity, and Sayonara Rolling Star are some of my favorites.
[09/16/18, 12:19:56 AM] <agentemerlad> Katamari on the Swing is a legendary Bop
[09/16/18, 12:19:56 AM] <NinjaFrogFu> Katamari on the Rocks is good too
[09/16/18, 12:19:56 AM] <onestormymorning> oh, steam? nice!
[09/16/18, 12:20:00 AM] <zr0v> Who originally created Katamari?
[09/16/18, 12:20:11 AM] <gamergabe18> @ProtonJon What about Touch My Katamari's soundtrack? No love for the vita.
[09/16/18, 12:20:20 AM] <AriZonia1> I really should check the OST of Forever because there was one song I LOVED but don't know the name
[09/16/18, 12:20:21 AM] <bronzefacade> I've only played Forever--

[09/16/18, 12:20:44 AM] <yanopi> ill be honest? we <3 katamari is better than katamari damacy
[09/16/18, 12:20:44 AM] <AtticusYK> they have their own style
[09/16/18, 12:20:45 AM] <Markpen2066> but I like three the most for Toy story meh opinions whatever their all good in my book
[09/16/18, 12:20:45 AM] <Volcarona333> Katamari on the Swing is probably in my top 10 video game songs.
[09/16/18, 12:20:49 AM] <kiran50> @ProtonJon could you give a sample of the song so some of us have an idea of the songs you're talking about
[09/16/18, 12:20:52 AM] <TheNegativePro> @wootmasterzorsx True, but sonic also has a large audience in games, and other media like comics and TV more than Mario, so I guess it's kind of a grey area
[09/16/18, 12:21:02 AM] <AriZonia1> @ProtonJon and then there was that one DanganRonpa song we all thought was Katamari during Thrown Controllers
[09/16/18, 12:21:09 AM] <citerel> There was an idolmaster song in this i think
[09/16/18, 12:21:19 AM] <YosukeKobe> there is
[09/16/18, 12:21:22 AM] <Lookingforcake> the older ones feel more upbeat
[09/16/18, 12:21:24 AM] <onestormymorning> yeah, its weird but catchy
[09/16/18, 12:21:24 AM] <agentemerlad> What was that clipping? protonGlitch

[09/16/18, 12:21:27 AM] <YosukeKobe> the imas song is because one of the stages in the offce.
[09/16/18, 12:21:28 AM] <wootmasterzorsx> @thenegativepro That's true, too. I forgot about the comics and everything that exists outside that.
[09/16/18, 12:21:30 AM] <JackTrevorXD> This music feels like a soundtrack you can't appreciate outside of the game similar to the DOOM 2016

[09/16/18, 12:21:34 AM] <Sephiroth1204> After the first 2 they had to figure out how to make new sounds without just doing remixes. And that's really tough

[09/16/18, 12:22:06 AM] <MarisaKirisamethe2nd> I'm pretty sure I had recognized the DR song and was freaking out that everyone got it wrong
[09/16/18, 12:22:06 AM] <DeltaPhoxtrot> @ProtonJon We Love Katamari is has the best song (Katamari on the Swing) but the original one has the best soundtrack overall.

[09/16/18, 12:29:30 AM] <3ternals0ul> @ProtonJon They have the legal right to do it, but it also shits in the face of those who try to preserve a bunch of games. As it stands, Kingdom Hearts 1's original files were lost in a fire, so for the remakes they had to reverse engineer a retail copy.

[09/16/18, 12:30:09 AM] <Muphum> I think FFX's source code was also lost, so the HD version was done from scratch
[09/16/18, 12:30:10 AM] <xilehnoc> Yep
[09/16/18, 12:30:11 AM] <garland41> Not only that, but @ProtonJon What about games with Fan Translations. People have played the games of the Fire Emblem series because fans translated the games that nintendo didn't.
[09/16/18, 12:30:12 AM] <kujo1229> For Spyro Reignited they couldn't use the source code so they instead made a program that mapped out the levels in the original games and ported those proportions and enemy behaviours into the remake.
[09/16/18, 12:30:12 AM] <Lookingforcake> As a FE fan especially tellius getting some games suck
[09/16/18, 12:30:14 AM] <Kidd_Decibel> Digital games are a double edged sword. The Good: Games are more available. The Bad, you need some sort of DRM to play them and that DRM could up and stop service and you will not be able to back up anymore.

[09/16/18, 12:30:20 AM] <Markpen2066> Which is why I'm glad Capcom keeps porting their shit cause I don't want to lose any of their titles if we can help it
[09/16/18, 12:30:24 AM] <3ternals0ul> @shadow_war Yeah, I think it was a fire. Either way, they did lose the source code for KH1 and had to remake it.
[09/16/18, 12:30:28 AM] <DrPepperNapalm> all those weird pre smartphone games are going to be lost soon
[09/16/18, 12:30:29 AM] <Capricete> PS1 games wouldn't make good source code for remakes, anyway.
[09/16/18, 12:30:30 AM] <Kidd_Decibel> And to clearify, Steam = DRM.
[09/16/18, 12:30:30 AM] <TehAstroGames> Source Code loss doesn't really affect making games availability, just makes remakes harder
[09/16/18, 12:30:31 AM] <Shiyonasan> SeemsGood
[09/16/18, 12:30:31 AM] <CrazyGirlEspeon> the thing with media is if stuff didn't get lost or destroyed so we aren't completely oversaturated in outdated crap

[09/16/18, 12:30:58 AM] <YukiMizuno> I think the original FFIX was also lost, which is why they took so long to get it remade.
[09/16/18, 12:31:04 AM] <Miatog42> @ProtonJon Blizzard lost the source code for Starcraft but thanks to a random fan who got a CD of it on ebay they were able to use it for the remake.

[09/16/18, 12:31:42 AM] <kiran50> i feel like some game sound tracks need slower songs to blend with the faster songs, so not all sound the same

[09/16/18, 1:15:25 AM] <3ternals0ul> And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why you probably shouldn't mix game actors with movie actors.
[09/16/18, 1:15:25 AM] <garland41> So, I learned this the other day that the Lizard was originally planned to be the villain for the third film but the studio pushed venom

[09/16/18, 1:16:00 AM] <TrojanHorse711> @ProtonJon I'll be honest, as someone who delivers food for a living that was weirdly cathartic, partly because I've NEVER seen the pizza minigame before
[09/16/18, 1:16:04 AM] <CounterpointClover> @TrevorBlade How dare you be here and support Jon's stream. Kappa
[09/16/18, 1:16:07 AM] <TSGJamesR> Dr. Connors is such an old lizard, isn't he? Kappa

[09/16/18, 1:16:23 AM] <garland41> But @ProtonJon Do you have to worry about paying rent in this game?
[09/16/18, 1:16:24 AM] <IcePhysics> You hold the L button to go faster

[09/16/18, 1:20:51 AM] <BlackDinoThunderRanger> wait stop
[09/16/18, 1:20:52 AM] <Muphum> Black Cat, that one character who's in every Spider-Man game despite not actually being that important of a Spider-Man character
[09/16/18, 1:20:56 AM] <Wandering_Spellsword> Holy shit,zip up your jumpsuit,lady. You're about 3 seconds away from raising the rating of this game!
[09/16/18, 1:20:57 AM] <Seraphim2000> hello, black cat...
[09/16/18, 1:21:00 AM] <DanGenesis> Oh hi Felicia
[09/16/18, 1:21:00 AM] <ArcadePark> Yeah, Black Cat's costume is always like that
[09/16/18, 1:21:08 AM] <ArcadePark> I know Catwoman's costume is fully closed
[09/16/18, 1:21:13 AM] <sanjian13> that was some serious cleavage in her costume
[09/16/18, 1:21:14 AM] <GokaiOrange> X-MEN LEGENDS PREVIEW
[09/16/18, 1:21:15 AM] <ArcadePark> Felicia let's her boobs hang out

[09/16/18, 1:21:29 AM] <ArcadePark> How do I shot web?\
[09/16/18, 1:21:30 AM] <galactickong1> @ArcadePark You have not seen catwoman in a while then.
[09/16/18, 1:21:31 AM] <Maverickhunterx> EXBAX
[09/16/18, 1:21:32 AM] <Wayward524> good thing she waited
[09/16/18, 1:21:34 AM] <Endaxil> i think running up walls is an upgrade in this game
[09/16/18, 1:21:39 AM] <owo_uwu_owo_my_dude> @protonjon how do i shot web?
[09/16/18, 1:21:44 AM] <ArcadePark> Wait, what happend to Catwoman?
[09/16/18, 1:21:46 AM] <CrazyGirlEspeon> FLAT IRON

[09/16/18, 1:21:51 AM] <kiran50> how do i play the game
[09/16/18, 1:21:52 AM] <Gameface252> Nice of them to give you a comet trail
[09/16/18, 1:21:54 AM] <pantaro> Wow, Black Cat can jump like Superman was a Kangaroo.
[09/16/18, 1:21:57 AM] <SilverKazeNinja> HOW DO I SHOT WEB?
[09/16/18, 1:21:57 AM] <bacterium_> You don't know when to quit!
[09/16/18, 1:22:00 AM] <CounterpointClover> Can someone turn off her halo? It's disturbing the traffic.
[09/16/18, 1:22:03 AM] <Syrian_Dude> someone's probably already made that joke
[09/16/18, 1:22:07 AM] <66Xeno> Yeah, Black Cat sure is good at teaching you how to swing, if you know what I mean.
[09/16/18, 1:22:09 AM] <DamonKatumaru> you can but you need to jump
[09/16/18, 1:22:09 AM] <shadow_war> @ProtonJon Is it the Run button maybe?
[09/16/18, 1:22:09 AM] <MightyGryphonGaming> thats an upgrade i think.
[09/16/18, 1:22:11 AM] <shinygaara65> LT is your turbo button. Try that and B.
[09/16/18, 1:22:11 AM] <soul_maestro> @ProtonJon You can use the button for Sprint to give yourself a boost of speed while swinging!
[09/16/18, 1:22:22 AM] <ArcadePark> Hulk Smashes
[09/16/18, 1:22:22 AM] <AvatarDeLite> I mean, this guy hasn't been Spider-Man for 8 years Kappa
[09/16/18, 1:22:23 AM] <IcePhysics> You don't ned much momentum, you can run up them if you're moving in that direction
[09/16/18, 1:22:24 AM] <Wayward524> that works
[09/16/18, 1:22:26 AM] <ArcadePark> He doesn't run up walls
[09/16/18, 1:22:30 AM] <Maverickhunterx> in the ultimate Spider-Man, you can run up
[09/16/18, 1:22:31 AM] <soul_maestro> You can eventually run up with enough upgrades
[09/16/18, 1:22:31 AM] <ArcadePark> He run walls up the air
[09/16/18, 1:22:31 AM] <agentemerlad> @ProtonJon Smash, smash smash
[09/16/18, 1:22:35 AM] <IgnitedRowlet> I ran up walls plent of times
[09/16/18, 1:22:36 AM] <ObiWattKenobi> There's no option to turn on inverted X-axis in the new one and it bothers me
[09/16/18, 1:22:38 AM] <JackTrevorXD> My favorite Spiderman moment is the moment Black Cat kisses Spiderman through his mask, finds out he's a teenage adult, then vomits on his chest
[09/16/18, 1:22:38 AM] <ArcadePark> Fair point
[09/16/18, 1:22:38 AM] <IcePhysics> You CAN run straight up
[09/16/18, 1:22:40 AM] <Xanaduzu> So basically the parkour system from sonic lost world?
[09/16/18, 1:22:41 AM] <Haula> Fuck gravity, I'm spiderman
[09/16/18, 1:22:42 AM] <Hallzfox39> You turn off the power.... That’s how you climb walls Kappa
[09/16/18, 1:22:42 AM] <EthanikoMargashi> So no one Remembers Spiderman Web of Shadows?
[09/16/18, 1:22:43 AM] <AngelsintheWindow> I just got back, how many games has he done since Glover?
[09/16/18, 1:22:44 AM] <kujo1229> Gwen Stacy.
[09/16/18, 1:22:45 AM] <Endaxil> @ProtonJon I believe running is an upgrade in this game
[09/16/18, 1:22:45 AM] <imadeadbrain> Constantly
[09/16/18, 1:22:45 AM] <agentemerlad> @ProtonJon Crash, crash crash (the game)
[09/16/18, 1:22:48 AM] <Uesugi_Tadao> You can run up walls in some of the later games I know
[09/16/18, 1:22:51 AM] <FusionFiction63> Pfff, screw gravity
[09/16/18, 1:22:55 AM] <CounterpointClover> "It's time to tryyyyy defyyyyyying graaaaaaaaavity!" :D
[09/16/18, 1:22:56 AM] <Slyguy46> Uhhhh ... I mean, Gwen Stacy might want to have a gripe against Gravity in Spiderman
[09/16/18, 1:23:02 AM] <Haula> Spiderman: Isaac Newton edition
[09/16/18, 1:23:03 AM] <QueenOfGlitch> and then spiderman ps4 patched it out
[09/16/18, 1:23:03 AM] <AvatarDeLite> LUL
[09/16/18, 1:23:05 AM] <MightyGryphonGaming> it was introduced in Dr. Connors clas
[09/16/18, 1:23:06 AM] <Floofledoo> LUL
[09/16/18, 1:23:07 AM] <RyuKageChroma> Gravity was introduced when... oh, that might be spoilers.
[09/16/18, 1:23:08 AM] <EthanikoMargashi> Black Cat is Felicia Hardy
[09/16/18, 1:23:15 AM] <ArcadePark> Gravity is a bitch
[09/16/18, 1:23:15 AM] <xilehnoc> ...was Black Cat in Spider Man 2?
[09/16/18, 1:23:15 AM] <IcePhysics> @EthanikoMargashi Yeah, in that game running up the walls is basically automatic if I remember
[09/16/18, 1:23:19 AM] <3ternals0ul> Um, excuse me? Gravity was invented by Valve for Half Life 2. They made an entire gun around the idea.
[09/16/18, 1:23:19 AM] <Vaati4554> going from yuri lowenthal spiderman to this is....oof
[09/16/18, 1:23:19 AM] <onlyachatter> The game was developed by Apple lead designer Issac Newton Kappa
[09/16/18, 1:23:19 AM] <DeltaPhoxtrot> Black Cat is the Not Catwoman.
[09/16/18, 1:23:20 AM] <justkingdion> do you have to actually catch her???
[09/16/18, 1:23:20 AM] <CounterpointClover> Maybe she got lost. :P
[09/16/18, 1:23:22 AM] <SLtheFMA> Its a combination of running with L, and jumping with A and X @ProtonJon
[09/16/18, 1:23:25 AM] <caliatom> Well I mean, it's not like you can shoot webs out of your feet, that'd be silly
[09/16/18, 1:23:26 AM] <ZeroFlame16> So when is Dr. Connors lecturing at captainfalconschool.com
[09/16/18, 1:23:27 AM] <ArcadePark> @xilehnoc NOt in the movie, only in this game
[09/16/18, 1:23:28 AM] <Alan_M00ch> My 11:30 cancelled.
[09/16/18, 1:23:36 AM] <Alan_M00ch> I can relate.
[09/16/18, 1:23:36 AM] <Slyguy46> Gwen Stacy dieing is like 50 years old, I think it's past the spoiler window
[09/16/18, 1:23:42 AM] <BlackDinoThunderRanger> dont u have somewhere to be yes doctor Connors class.. @ProtonJon LUL

[09/16/18, 1:23:47 AM] <Wayward524> there's a ton of extra villains in the game like shocker and mysterio
[09/16/18, 1:23:48 AM] <FusionFiction63> @xilehnoc The movie? No. These movie-to-game adaptations tended to add more villians.
[09/16/18, 1:23:53 AM] <Soundmeister> Is this Spider Man HD?
[09/16/18, 1:23:57 AM] <Bramnet> I don't remember this character in the movie...

[09/16/18, 1:24:17 AM] <Cloud3514> I remember the first movie game had some scenes from the movie, but was mostly its own story and the villain was The Vulture.
[09/16/18, 1:24:20 AM] <EthanikoMargashi> YES that was so good

[09/16/18, 1:26:11 AM] <wootmasterzorsx> @arcadepark Nope, you're right. He wants Spider-Man to get pictures of Peter Parker because he doesn't ever get pictures of Spider-Man, so he wants to see why Peter can't ever get the pictures.

[09/16/18, 1:28:36 AM] <tobbysas> Ouch, that hurts my soul
[09/16/18, 1:28:36 AM] <Bramnet> <.<
[09/16/18, 1:28:37 AM] <Cloud3514> Yup. The Duke had the arcade style 6 button layout. It's a better layout for fighting games... and that's about it.

[09/16/18, 1:28:50 AM] <ArcadePark> I have BABY hands
[09/16/18, 1:28:51 AM] <fireflye645> Legit worse than the N64 controller.
[09/16/18, 1:28:51 AM] <Bramnet> and people wonder why I liked the n64 controler...
[09/16/18, 1:28:51 AM] <Slyguy46> BIG
[09/16/18, 1:28:52 AM] <grebobly> Its at least better than the N64 controller?
[09/16/18, 1:28:54 AM] <JackTrevorXD> So this was a controller meant for me
[09/16/18, 1:28:55 AM] <TacticalFail> XBOX HUGE
[09/16/18, 1:28:55 AM] <Peeps958> I have a friend who prefers it to the smaller ones
[09/16/18, 1:28:56 AM] <TSGJamesR> But from what I heard, the Xbox One compatible Duke controller sucks and is cheap-feeling @ProtonJon
[09/16/18, 1:28:56 AM] <Xanaduzu> Why make the center logo SO MASSIVE?
[09/16/18, 1:28:57 AM] <Kasumi89> I could not use that controller because I have small hands
[09/16/18, 1:28:59 AM] <Slyguy46> BIG MEATY CLAWS
[09/16/18, 1:28:59 AM] <Alan_M00ch> Come again??
[09/16/18, 1:29:02 AM] <BadRoad> You know what they say about a guy with huge hands.... He has a huge XBox controller.
[09/16/18, 1:29:03 AM] <Sitiran> I have huge hands. I liked the original one.

[09/16/18, 1:29:08 AM] <agentemerlad> @ProtonJon Where did the name "The Duke" come from?
[09/16/18, 1:29:13 AM] <3ternals0ul> @ProtonJon Jonah is played by Charles Klausmeyer, he voices Raphael in Soul Calibur, and "Citizens of Metropolis" in the Superman Returns game.
[09/16/18, 1:29:14 AM] <Madd_the_Sane> Relic of the time, and relic of its Dreamcast heritage.

[09/16/18, 1:29:26 AM] <ArcadePark> That movie music
[09/16/18, 1:29:27 AM] <TheAmazingMistaC> They call it The Duke because it's real big.
[09/16/18, 1:29:28 AM] <ArthurCross7> yep the duke you could beat someone with it lol
[09/16/18, 1:29:34 AM] <coatboy> Oh no, Doctor Connor's class
[09/16/18, 1:29:34 AM] <Cloud3514> Also, I LOVED having the start and back buttons under my left thumb. Also, I disagree about the D-pad. I think the X1's d-pad is fantastic.
[09/16/18, 1:29:34 AM] <Slyguy46> Yeah, the VA for JJJ is not the same as Frank West, sorry @ProtonJon

[09/16/18, 1:31:21 AM] <Flame_Hyenard> @damonkatumaru that joke doesn't work for him.
[09/16/18, 1:31:24 AM] <EthanikoMargashi> @ArcadePark yes

[09/16/18, 1:31:25 AM] <justkingdion> ?????
[09/16/18, 1:31:28 AM] <ArcadePark> Oh
[09/16/18, 1:31:30 AM] <Doublematt_1> okay, Robbie totally knows that Pete is Spider-Man
[09/16/18, 1:31:32 AM] <ArcadePark> I'm stupid
[09/16/18, 1:31:35 AM] <bacterium_> At least you can actually see the city unlike Superman 64

[09/16/18, 1:31:39 AM] <MarsTehPants> @DamonKatumaru Nuh Uh in the new game every bad guy comes with a preloaded web net to grab hium to the nearest wall :P
[09/16/18, 1:31:40 AM] <garland41> @ProtonJon I'm surprise that J Jonah Jameson never questions Peter how he got the pictures of Spiderman
[09/16/18, 1:31:40 AM] <Dgtl_Ronin042> I forgot how much I liked photography
[09/16/18, 1:31:40 AM] <tobbysas> This music is way too good.

[09/16/18, 1:31:45 AM] <TSGJamesR> But it was one of the best open-world games of it's time too. :3

[09/16/18, 1:31:49 AM] <Uesugi_Tadao> What?
[09/16/18, 1:31:50 AM] <Bramnet> it's kinda nice how the map even shows you where the marker's height is relative to spider-man @ProtonJon
[09/16/18, 1:31:56 AM] <NintenES> Oh no question that Robbie knows that you're spider-man
[09/16/18, 1:31:56 AM] <ArcadePark> Isabelle for Smash
[09/16/18, 1:32:00 AM] <Mike_the_Magician> I hope J.J. knows these shots are something that only Spider Man can take, but he expects Peter to take these pictures casually @ProtonJon
[09/16/18, 1:32:02 AM] <shadow_war> @ProtonJon One of my favourite things to do in this game was grab an enemy and bring as high up as I can, then pile drive them to the ground.
[09/16/18, 1:32:03 AM] <TSGJamesR> Not quite GTA3 or San Andreas.
[09/16/18, 1:32:03 AM] <ArcadePark> Now we can Smash Isabelle

[09/16/18, 1:32:34 AM] <justkingdion> @protonjon I forgot Treyarch made these Spiderman games. it does show how time has changed, since Treyarch went on to make 3 extremely well received Call of Duty games
[09/16/18, 1:32:35 AM] <shadow_war> I believe there's about 3-4 different types.

[09/16/18, 1:32:56 AM] <TSGJamesR> @ProtonJon Apparently the oddly specific ethyl chloride anti-spider pesticide is Spidey's kryptonite. minikiS

[09/16/18, 1:52:57 AM] <xilehnoc> @ProtonJon "It's hard to get inside the existential paradox of Kroeger's life on tour: Every day, he gives interviews to journalists and radio DJs who directly ask him why no one likes his band. Every night, he plays music to thousands of enraptured superfans, many of whom love him with a ferocity that's probably unhealthy."
[09/16/18, 1:53:01 AM] <citerel> Nickelback is so ok
[09/16/18, 1:53:03 AM] <AtticusYK> that statement has many ways to be proven wrong.
[09/16/18, 1:53:04 AM] <XenoDanganMonicals> It's that... their first album SUCKED. and it was weird

[09/16/18, 1:53:28 AM] <AngelsintheWindow> They shit on them because the songs are the same and because THEY WERE SUNG ALL THE TIME!
[09/16/18, 1:53:31 AM] <ArcadePark> @ProtonJon Remember the time when Peter Parker and Doc Oct Switch Minds?
