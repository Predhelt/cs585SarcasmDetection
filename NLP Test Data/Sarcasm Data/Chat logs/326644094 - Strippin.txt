[10/23/18, 10:24:22 PM] <Belutima> @bloomac77 they activate soul Charge, their super mode, that gives you new moves, and does littl chip damage
[10/23/18, 10:24:27 PM] <thecakewuzalie> you dont start the game with that attack

[10/23/18, 10:27:11 PM] <Todo_of_Aksum> @MiracleJohnson yes it is the same voice actor from W3
[10/23/18, 10:27:12 PM] <Fenriswolfborn> Yeah
[10/23/18, 10:27:18 PM] <MiracleJohnson> Weird
[10/23/18, 10:27:21 PM] <ryanwh> when he talks it sounds like him, some of the grunts seem to be a different dude
[10/23/18, 10:27:22 PM] <Fenriswolfborn> But not the same also
[10/23/18, 10:27:26 PM] <futuresight23> That can happen when voice acting roles are years apart
[10/23/18, 10:27:45 PM] <MiracleJohnson> Maybe they just got someone else for the fighting sounds?

[10/23/18, 10:30:58 PM] <Professional_Moron101> you should use reversal edge for the pressure

[10/23/18, 10:32:26 PM] <sarge855> @Monster_Haven ive playred every soul calibur to ever come out its worth it its fun
[10/23/18, 10:32:27 PM] <RacorasKitty> did Strippin make the 2B look on-stream or before?
[10/23/18, 10:32:32 PM] <MiracleJohnson> So chat, is Ivy shit in this game? I haven't seen her at all.
[10/23/18, 10:32:39 PM] <MiracleJohnson> Off stream RacorasKitty
[10/23/18, 10:32:43 PM] <Nathillon> @Monster_Haven Soul Calibur is a good game to start actually. It's simple on the surface and deep when you get into it. Solid place to start.
[10/23/18, 10:32:44 PM] <Scorched_0> Ivy's top tier
[10/23/18, 10:32:47 PM] <Nekros4442> Ivy is definitely one of the better characters in the game
[10/23/18, 10:32:48 PM] <sarge855> @MiracleJohnson ivy is never shit she just complicated
[10/23/18, 10:32:48 PM] <Disskio> she's great
[10/23/18, 10:32:49 PM] <Raen_> LOOOOOOOOOOL
[10/23/18, 10:32:50 PM] <Scorched_0> She's just really difficult
[10/23/18, 10:32:50 PM] <Professional_Moron101> @Strippin you should try using reversal edge if you're getting too pressured
[10/23/18, 10:32:51 PM] <Richard94588> haha

[10/23/18, 10:33:17 PM] <Monster_Haven> are the characters closely balanced or is there like a couple characters far above the rest?
[10/23/18, 10:33:27 PM] <ryanwh> I think stremers avoid Ivy for TOS concerns
[10/23/18, 10:33:34 PM] <Omakie> @Monster_Haven most are really close

[10/23/18, 10:33:45 PM] <sarge855> @Monster_Haven geralt and cervantes are super broken

[10/23/18, 10:34:17 PM] <sarge855> @Omakie as a nightmare main i can assure u he isnt broke
[10/23/18, 10:34:17 PM] <Scorched_0> He just has so many guard impacts
[10/23/18, 10:34:21 PM] <Belutima> @Monster_Haven its one of the more balanced Soul Caliburs, there are a couple of Easy dmg characters, but once you figure out how they work you can block it pretty easily
[10/23/18, 10:34:25 PM] <THGRGDFHSGFHSDHGSFDHFGRFH> they should ban voldo cuz of his cock items stripLewd

[10/23/18, 10:35:24 PM] <Omakie> geralt is a character you reversal edge a ton
[10/23/18, 10:35:25 PM] <sarge855> @Omakie no he is alot slower then u think if u get in close you have him almost everytime
[10/23/18, 10:35:28 PM] <Scorched_0> @HFancy1997 He's playing a custom 2B
[10/23/18, 10:35:29 PM] <Nekros4442> Reversal Edge doesnt give a shit about hi low mix ups Sam
[10/23/18, 10:35:31 PM] <Kayanagi> @HFancy1997 customize character, its 2B from Nier Automata

[10/23/18, 10:35:34 PM] <Darkaros> @HFancy1997 Yeah, you can make custom characters with people's movesets
[10/23/18, 10:35:37 PM] <JonarodzDT> @HFancy1997 Custom made character modeled after 2B using Sieg's moveset
[10/23/18, 10:35:40 PM] <bloomac77> sonic fox plays geralt so ya hes probably broke
[10/23/18, 10:35:40 PM] <ryanwh> if you cant beat em, make a Ciri and use the broken boy's moveset
[10/23/18, 10:35:41 PM] <GotTheJuice93> Idk how to do anything in this game, never tells you about counter moves or anything
[10/23/18, 10:35:41 PM] <RacorasKitty> havent people been telling you Siegfriend's moveset is super slow and meant for range/counters?
[10/23/18, 10:35:45 PM] <Professional_Moron101> @try pressing K once they're done doing they're strings to get some space

[10/23/18, 10:36:21 PM] <Omakie> @sarge855 i disagree he is faster then anyone using a 8 foot sword should be especially with 1 hand and the fact he has 200ms counters in close
[10/23/18, 10:36:34 PM] <Belutima> you can Reversel Edge and Block instead of doing an attack, it basically resets everything. and you gain meter @Strippin but carefull of guard break meter.
[10/23/18, 10:36:37 PM] <ryanwh> anybody made a Leonidas yet

[10/23/18, 10:38:44 PM] <Omakie> @sarge855 once again i think that he is very strong but not broken at all. he is beatable and he has weaknesses. i also believe geralt is much stronger

[10/23/18, 10:41:07 PM] <Belutima> @Monster_Haven there is a Lethal hit that you can do, that destroys armor
[10/23/18, 10:41:09 PM] <Disskio> reversal edge gives a ton of bar

[10/23/18, 10:41:12 PM] <Nathillon> @Monster_Haven Strong hits like break attacks wear down armor's durability and it breaks eventually. At least, that's how I THINK the system works. Has no effect besides... Well, being naked.
[10/23/18, 10:41:15 PM] <JordanZX> Re and gaurd impact
[10/23/18, 10:41:17 PM] <Grimango> asteroth isnt the slowest?
[10/23/18, 10:41:19 PM] <ModusTrollens69> last round you get 1 bar free, also Reversal Edge and just hitting shit
[10/23/18, 10:41:19 PM] <Zeiphie> losing also gets your bar...but that's not ideal

[10/23/18, 10:42:09 PM] <Belutima> Kicks are most of the time the Fastest attack for any character, it interrupt basically all combos, @Strippin try a low kick, or back kick.
[10/23/18, 10:42:10 PM] <Nichego> so if you are in lead they get extra bar for being disadvantage

[10/23/18, 10:47:25 PM] <Nekros4442> When he has the glowy shit around him you need to be careful cus he gets access to a buffed ass move
[10/23/18, 10:47:26 PM] <Madracah> @Strippin are you sure spending 2 Bars on sould charge was better then 2 supers ?
[10/23/18, 10:47:29 PM] <BadPunsGuy> He has more openings

[10/23/18, 10:47:37 PM] <Coldphenix> according to the game, Sieg is a more defensive style

[10/23/18, 10:52:47 PM] <Professional_Moron101> best super
[10/23/18, 10:52:49 PM] <Argumus> that was epic
[10/23/18, 10:52:50 PM] <Belutima> @Strippin Best and safest way to get up, is No direction and hold Block. Rolling back is almost always unsafe, and rolling sideways is situational.
[10/23/18, 10:52:51 PM] <Piconjo> hit him low
[10/23/18, 10:52:54 PM] <Idxearo> u kept rolling at one point
[10/23/18, 10:52:56 PM] <Piconjo> All you have to do is grab or hit low
[10/23/18, 10:52:57 PM] <Raen_> nightmare seems a bit op from what i've watched

[10/23/18, 10:52:59 PM] <ryanwh> what a showoff
[10/23/18, 10:53:03 PM] <sarge855> @Strippin like i said you would hate me i main nightmare
[10/23/18, 10:53:05 PM] <blubbersub> his special guard is annoying
[10/23/18, 10:53:08 PM] <Doomed2Die> less mixup tho
[10/23/18, 10:53:11 PM] <ElysianJinx> you just have to hit low
[10/23/18, 10:53:11 PM] <Disskio> yeah your big problem was you kept rollign back when you got knocked down, rolling to the side would have prevented the 60% combos
[10/23/18, 10:53:12 PM] <Crusnik004> more sidestepping
[10/23/18, 10:53:13 PM] <Piconjo> His revenge mechanic doesn't block lows
[10/23/18, 10:53:13 PM] <luusydh> is strippin playing on pc or ps4 or?
[10/23/18, 10:53:14 PM] <Idxearo> thing is nightmare once u know his moveset he just gets parried
[10/23/18, 10:53:17 PM] <kazen01> Nightmare is straight forward in that regard
[10/23/18, 10:53:18 PM] <JustGrimley> hus is true, but you have the same speed
[10/23/18, 10:53:22 PM] <ryanwh> I mean yeah he was the final boss for a bunch of games right
[10/23/18, 10:53:23 PM] <ModusTrollens69> you can lab him a bit to learn his moves, so you can prepare yourself @Strippin
[10/23/18, 10:53:24 PM] <Tarot13> never roll against nightmare he will always hit you getting up use horizontal slash from the ground to stand
[10/23/18, 10:53:25 PM] <JustGrimley> this*
[10/23/18, 10:53:38 PM] <Nichego> @Raen_ hes not really its just if you let him get momentum its really hard to deal with for newer players

[10/23/18, 10:57:09 PM] <wydyadoit_live> @ErikPhantom a staple of this game is that you have 3 tiers of clothing and if you take too much heavy damage to an area you lose that set of armor.

[10/23/18, 11:03:33 PM] <bloomac77> its got a darkest dungeon vibe but much more detailed
[10/23/18, 11:03:38 PM] <somerandomlurk> Oh this game seems ok
[10/23/18, 11:03:50 PM] <wydyadoit_live> this allows me to perform any action at ease on a controller @PervertedOldMan and it actually flows very naturally since even if you dont know how to end a combo if you press a trigger it's basically a get out of jail free card.
[10/23/18, 11:03:57 PM] <ryanwh> they've gotten real good at motion graphics

[10/23/18, 11:04:53 PM] <Darkaros> Card game RPG
[10/23/18, 11:05:06 PM] <MrGunner2You> lol intro "Cogsworth" from HL4
[10/23/18, 11:05:07 PM] <Lifenn> wydyadoit_live its like gwent from witcher 3 but with story
[10/23/18, 11:05:12 PM] <bloomac77> @PervertedOldMan fair enough people are far less disposable in this game lol
[10/23/18, 11:05:13 PM] <PanzaVerde> isometric rpg with card battles
[10/23/18, 11:05:20 PM] <Ophirin> So like the Pokémon TCG game but with Gwent?
[10/23/18, 11:05:34 PM] <ryanwh> this version of gwent is quite a bit different from witcher 3. This is like gwent 3.0
[10/23/18, 11:05:44 PM] <wydyadoit_live> @Lifenn @Darkaros but is the card game the same as gwent? or is it different?
[10/23/18, 11:05:49 PM] <MrGunner2You> @Ophirin yea sure why not
[10/23/18, 11:05:51 PM] <Darkaros> It's Gwent but with only 2 lanes
[10/23/18, 11:05:59 PM] <Lifenn> wydyadoit_live its different but similar
[10/23/18, 11:06:04 PM] <Darkaros> And a bunch of card differences, but you earn cards for actual-multiplayer-gwent too
[10/23/18, 11:06:22 PM] <Lifenn> Strippin your game category still says Soulcalibur
[10/23/18, 11:06:34 PM] <Ophirin> @MrGunner2You I mean the original Pokémon TCG video game is the best pokemon spin off game
[10/23/18, 11:06:43 PM] <kazen01> say thronebreaker
[10/23/18, 11:06:43 PM] <ryanwh> my soul still burns for card battles

[10/23/18, 11:07:04 PM] <wydyadoit_live> BUT it's not gwent, but it's a gwent clone. is it easier or harder?
[10/23/18, 11:07:13 PM] <Darkaros> @Ophirin I remember/love that game too, it's kinda like it but Gwent is like the way a fight is fought, rather than literally YuGiOh shit where you duel monsters lol

[10/23/18, 11:07:20 PM] <PMmoloo> @wydyadoit_live they completely overhauled the Gwent mechanics, so this is now consistent with what Gwent is now
[10/23/18, 11:07:43 PM] <wydyadoit_live> @PMmoloo i dont understand.
[10/23/18, 11:07:46 PM] <Lifenn> wydyadoit_live its a 2 lane version of gwent i personally dont know much about it havent watched much
[10/23/18, 11:07:50 PM] <PervertedOldMan> @wydyadoit_live they made a standalone CCG based on the Gwent on Witcher 3, it's similar to old gwent in concept but really different on practice

[10/23/18, 11:08:43 PM] <Meridan67> is this the dragon queen from the witcher 2?
[10/23/18, 11:08:48 PM] <PanzaVerde> If you talk to her again she gives something I think

[10/23/18, 11:09:04 PM] <PervertedOldMan> @Strippin I play regular gwent, if you have any questions about the mechanics feel free to ask (although I don't know if thronebreaker is 100% like the game)
[10/23/18, 11:09:23 PM] <zenbear> So you gotta scour and sniff every little plant, and container. Yep definitely witcher Kappa

[10/23/18, 11:11:11 PM] <PervertedOldMan> @wydyadoit_live this game is paid, but you can play the card game itself for free and it's really f2p friendly

[10/23/18, 11:13:41 PM] <zenbear> @PervertedOldMan Oh haven't played it in awhilr
[10/23/18, 11:13:45 PM] <MrCanadianAviator> Dont think you needed to play that car at the end

[10/23/18, 11:14:03 PM] <PervertedOldMan> @zenbear unless you play on console you can play this version
[10/23/18, 11:14:21 PM] <yamamotorgmto> is it sfree?
[10/23/18, 11:14:31 PM] <kazen01> no

[10/23/18, 11:15:09 PM] <Colgaldy> @Strippin Note, you don't have to play every card in your hand each round, you draw 3 but keep whatever you end the round with.
[10/23/18, 11:15:11 PM] <RacorasKitty> a woofgirl goes AWOOOO ?

[10/23/18, 11:16:22 PM] <Colgaldy> This game is definitely beautiful though.
[10/23/18, 11:16:36 PM] <zenbear> Ohhhh treasure
[10/23/18, 11:16:46 PM] <wydyadoit_live> @Strippin i love the animations, but the card game itself reminds me of the digimon world 3 card game just with witcher themes.

[10/23/18, 11:49:05 PM] <converg> I did it
[10/23/18, 11:49:06 PM] <Improbablewoble> ive heard 1 and 2 had rough controls
[10/23/18, 11:49:07 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> Sure
[10/23/18, 11:49:07 PM] <streamChef> Yup, Withcer 1 and 2 haven't aged very well
[10/23/18, 11:49:07 PM] <aussielokken> witcher 1 would be terrible, 2 would be possible, 3 would be the most fun and you get a decent amount of backstory
[10/23/18, 11:49:09 PM] <Boshean> Wait this has witcher 3 spoilers?
[10/23/18, 11:49:11 PM] <Aullama> Yeah, just play 3 imo. Though you should play 2 during a later stream too.
[10/23/18, 11:49:12 PM] <OtoriTV> 100% Would love to see you play it.
[10/23/18, 11:49:20 PM] <Levodoom> Witcher 2 is decent, but Witcher 1 is a big aged at this point
[10/23/18, 11:49:21 PM] <okatera> witcher 1 is... an acquired taste. 2 has a good story and alright gameplay. 3 is very good (although the controls can be a bit frustrating). you can totally skip 1 and 2

[10/24/18, 12:23:26 AM] <BigFatSnarf> Didn't your other hero power let you use orders again? Maybe that's what they're thinking?
[10/24/18, 12:23:28 AM] <ErikPhantom> could be that Meve's equip is not what you want for this particular fight

[10/24/18, 12:23:44 AM] <Colgaldy> @ErikPhantom He needs it.
[10/24/18, 12:23:48 AM] <Kurtzburg> you should upgrade the cards at camp for loyal abilities, for synergy with the queen's ability
[10/24/18, 12:23:50 AM] <Mujona> There needs to be 2 cows on the same HP level, or they die.

[10/24/18, 12:24:19 AM] <WonderDuckie> check the loyal abilities of your cards, i think the arablist one causes them to attack?
[10/24/18, 12:24:22 AM] <Colgaldy> Other way though.
[10/24/18, 12:24:57 AM] <Ophirin> first move needs to be to play an arbalest and shoot a cow from 4 health down to 3
[10/24/18, 12:24:58 AM] <CryoCryptic> @Strippin use the leader ability to bring a pikeman to the front, then drop the drummer for the pikeman

[10/24/18, 12:25:04 AM] <PervertedOldMan> @Strippin The drummer summons the top unit of your deck, so you use her to put the unit that summons all units from your deck

[10/24/18, 12:56:45 AM] <Kurtzburg> he moves around, you have to surround him with high power cards
[10/24/18, 12:56:46 AM] <Hoothe> @Strippin You have to keep him swarmed it seems with strong cards
[10/24/18, 12:56:51 AM] <PillB_> 21 total in every row basically

[10/24/18, 12:58:56 AM] <ErikPhantom> I think that buff potion will be good here
[10/24/18, 12:59:08 AM] <ValiantEffort> ^
[10/24/18, 12:59:11 AM] <warlord13179> It's only adjacent units. So you have to have a total of 19 power in the units 1 to the left or right of him
[10/24/18, 12:59:13 AM] <Colgaldy> The idea is to have the units on either side of him have combined power higher than his @Strippin
[10/24/18, 12:59:31 AM] <Kurtzburg> the sum of the card value on either side of him has to be larger than the number on his card to damage
[10/24/18, 12:59:32 AM] <ErikPhantom> Ups a unit by 10, easy to get above him and then whittle him down
[10/24/18, 12:59:45 AM] <Kurtzburg> surround him with high power cards

[10/24/18, 1:16:14 AM] <knight4light> single player gwent
[10/24/18, 1:16:16 AM] <GardarFlanks> it is gwent
[10/24/18, 1:16:19 AM] <Colgaldy> @TheBiff It is Gwent. new gwent at least.
[10/24/18, 1:16:26 AM] <TheBiff> interesting
[10/24/18, 1:16:39 AM] <GardarFlanks> it's just gwent puzzles though so not 'really' gwent
[10/24/18, 1:16:49 AM] <TheBiff> last time i played gwent there were three rows so thats why i wasn't sure
[10/24/18, 1:16:54 AM] <Konges> Why does Sam not kill the man in front?
[10/24/18, 1:16:59 AM] <somerandomlurk> There is card combat
[10/24/18, 1:17:00 AM] <Master_Metroid> @Strippin just need a few more units before you use the wagon.
[10/24/18, 1:17:01 AM] <Darkaros> I mean this fight right now is actual Gwent, just two lanes instead of three.

[10/24/18, 1:17:26 AM] <GardarFlanks> Darkaros not really. the opponent passed turn 1. it's just ordering your cards
[10/24/18, 1:17:30 AM] <Master_Metroid> RIP
[10/24/18, 1:17:45 AM] <Konges> And another fail

[10/24/18, 1:18:05 AM] <Improbablewoble> wasnt gwent you own by number? how do you win this one?
[10/24/18, 1:18:06 AM] <Darkaros> @GardarFlanks Actually yeah you're right this one's a puzzle. But there's actual-Gwent-turn-by-turns later.

[10/24/18, 1:19:13 AM] <Colgaldy> @SokyBoBo Yup
[10/24/18, 1:19:24 AM] <Master_Metroid> The Decoy can recall drummer, the arbalest can be what kills the envoy as well

[10/24/18, 1:21:30 AM] <Colgaldy> He was 'bout to say something then decided this was the best outcome for him.

[10/24/18, 1:21:55 AM] <warlord13179> Maybe from behind that castle
[10/24/18, 1:21:57 AM] <wolfeng_> time to reform the land and cut down some trees
[10/24/18, 1:21:59 AM] <PitfallHarry100> maybe from the other side of the fort?
[10/24/18, 1:22:01 AM] <typhus1138> fine then. keep your secrets
[10/24/18, 1:22:01 AM] <Master_Metroid> Its a large castle wall

[10/24/18, 1:24:21 AM] <Master_Metroid> Pikemen pretty bad in this deck, you only have 2, and if you draw them, they basically have no abilitiy
[10/24/18, 1:24:30 AM] <Master_Metroid> definitely way better in large numbers
[10/24/18, 1:25:35 AM] <CokedupChocobo> YOu choose when it ends
[10/24/18, 1:25:37 AM] <Levodoom> YOU end it
[10/24/18, 1:25:37 AM] <Yooshlitz> when someone passes
[10/24/18, 1:25:39 AM] <GardarFlanks> oof
[10/24/18, 1:25:39 AM] <simpliv> When you both pass @Strippin
