[11/30/18, 2:18:49 PM] <fightelement> its the dodge window. on apocalyptic its super tiny until you get obscurus which boosts dodge window
[11/30/18, 2:18:50 PM] <ForsakenWillRise> @MoonDuck the real answer is it depends but if you are seeing 80C to 90C thats about as high as u want it to go higher is no good
[11/30/18, 2:18:51 PM] <Felinebird> i think you are supposed to dodge outside the attack areas, the immunity frame is so low, you an dodge the attack but since you're still in its area of effect when the immunity frame ends, you still take damage
