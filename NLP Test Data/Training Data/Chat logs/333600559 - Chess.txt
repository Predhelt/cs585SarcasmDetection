[11/9/18, 10:22:54 AM] <FiveCardDraw> nothing wrong with magnus position, those double pawns control lots of squares
[11/9/18, 10:22:55 AM] <Imnottheswarm> Just castle? TPFufun i'm already helpless
[11/9/18, 10:22:57 AM] <EOGuel> @annul, Magnus played b6? That seems like a bad move

[11/9/18, 11:17:57 AM] <Moobot> GM Fabiano Caruana qualified as challenger by winning the 2018 Candidates Tournament. This was an eight player, double round-robin tournament played in Berlin on March 10â28, 2018
[11/9/18, 11:17:59 AM] <mgeud> Its a best of 12 , and if draw then rapid , if draw then blitz

[11/9/18, 11:18:03 AM] <crazycoffeeman> @Shtanjel - this will be a 12 game match to decide the World Champion. The contender was decided earlier this year in an 8 player double-round robin tournament
[11/9/18, 11:18:04 AM] <maxmlynek> @Shtanjel tournaments are more random. Thats why its bad idea to have tournaments winner as WC. We need looong match
[11/9/18, 11:18:08 AM] <cyberhye> Shankland doesn't deserve the title of US Chess Champion. Since he can't support Fabiano, he should give back his title.

[11/9/18, 1:18:09 PM] <Sk4rm0ry> carlsen taking an uncharacteristically sharp approach. he probably could have done just as well playing to exploit the weak dark squares on the queenside or the doubled h-pawns. if it works it's probably only because caruana is already low on time

[11/9/18, 1:21:33 PM] <inigofreed> you have to calculate differently when you are thinking on your opponents turn, tactics aren't as accessible but you can still look at how the end game plays out with these pawns.
