[11/4/18, 8:38:19 AM] <Capownz> UI is tied to FOV i think
[11/4/18, 8:38:20 AM] <An_Elephant12> Chaning the FOV makes you run faster

[11/4/18, 8:38:32 AM] <lac5ap> You have to change it in the game folder, not the documents folder.

[11/4/18, 8:38:34 AM] <Ureshix> the UI is tied to the FOV so....
[11/4/18, 8:38:34 AM] <TuckerSaltyForLife> fallout 74 LUL
[11/4/18, 8:38:35 AM] <jigi5> @CohhCarnage It works but it resets if you die or quick travel
[11/4/18, 8:38:36 AM] <BigenzTR> @CohhCarnage it feels like fallout 76 was a console port to PC the way the UI and everything feels

[11/4/18, 8:38:37 AM] <ViewBotTest1> NexusMod to the rescue
[11/4/18, 8:38:37 AM] <TheCheshireHat> ini edit it works... until you use vats or fast travel
[11/4/18, 8:38:41 AM] <LokiFM> @CohhCarnage You need to make a Fallout76custom . ini in your documents and add the FoV in there; VATS does break the FoV back down though
[11/4/18, 8:38:42 AM] <CohhilitionBot> @ulukator Cohh loves interacting with chat & viewers, so please try to keep conversations in English! Thanks for understanding cohhGG
[11/4/18, 8:38:42 AM] <Myekos> it sounds like you're saying FOB, from the comments it sounds like it should be FOV which is field of view

[11/4/18, 8:39:21 AM] <AleksAlex> There are some really strange mechanics in the fallout engine. For exmaple the pipboy color and light intensity is tied to the flashlight for some reason.

[11/4/18, 9:18:52 AM] <johnygeds> no hype whatsoever for 76

[11/4/18, 9:18:59 AM] <Tysonions> @cohhcarnage what do you think of the framerate being tied to character speed?

[11/4/18, 9:19:13 AM] <capnshredder> @Aghamyr there are specific areas u can capture that are bigger and offer a huge space
[11/4/18, 9:19:14 AM] <SunlitKarma> I wish my beta went as smoothly
[11/4/18, 9:19:14 AM] <ShannonZKiller> i mean... there's DEF some lil kinks to work out.... fps drop in towns is one. push to talk another. for sure.
[11/4/18, 9:19:15 AM] <Drag0nz> @CohhCarnage Did you know Bethesda gave all the BETA users 3 codes to invite friends to the Fallout 76 Beta?
[11/4/18, 9:19:15 AM] <Luna_Is_BestPrincess> In 2 weeks cohhDerp

[11/4/18, 9:19:19 AM] <firefly24> They also need to fix the Budget for bases

[11/4/18, 9:19:20 AM] <ShannonZKiller> but overall it was THE FEELING.
[11/4/18, 9:19:20 AM] <george_wells03> How many chapters are there in total in the game?
[11/4/18, 9:19:20 AM] <adole_aldrich> !baby
[11/4/18, 9:19:23 AM] <relair> ghost players talking after you close the game? :D
[11/4/18, 9:19:23 AM] <LilFighterJet> They need to completely redo PvP
[11/4/18, 9:19:23 AM] <oblivion6686> ohh you have not been in power armour have you?
[11/4/18, 9:19:24 AM] <firefly24> IMO they are too small
[11/4/18, 9:19:26 AM] <babedi_bubedi> @CohhCarnage what about movement speed tied to fps?
[11/4/18, 9:19:26 AM] <Darkomax> bethesda fixing things danKEK
[11/4/18, 9:19:26 AM] <Draquta> push to talk? thats hard to fix Kappa
[11/4/18, 9:19:27 AM] <Brs2410> Skip again
[11/4/18, 9:19:27 AM] <wilcore2017> you can set the fov in INI file
[11/4/18, 9:19:28 AM] <aradim> The PVP is the biggest issue for me, either it's unrestricted or I won't buy it
[11/4/18, 9:19:30 AM] <salelar1967> whats wrong with the pvp
[11/4/18, 9:19:30 AM] <h1z4rd> last one is design decision not gonna happen
[11/4/18, 9:19:32 AM] <Toxikbrain> is pvp forced? or are there pve servers where you and your base is safe?
[11/4/18, 9:19:33 AM] <Voobyples> !time
[11/4/18, 9:19:33 AM] <CohhilitionBot> CohhCarnage's time is currently 9:19 AM EST
[11/4/18, 9:19:33 AM] <loopyNid> better game engine
[11/4/18, 9:19:34 AM] <MrEmeralddragon> By PVP changes do you mean actually allow pvp?
[11/4/18, 9:19:35 AM] <conker4> boop
[11/4/18, 9:19:37 AM] <Kataphractt> @CohhCarnage It's common for betas to increase spawn rates on both enemies and items so we'll have to wait for Launch
[11/4/18, 9:19:37 AM] <minicilp13> Yep
[11/4/18, 9:19:38 AM] <ghorkyn> Oh wow was pvp a problem for you @CohhCarnage ? I didnt have any problems with it
[11/4/18, 9:19:38 AM] <Nanolion> angry cohhboys Kappa

[11/4/18, 9:19:39 AM] <Egergames> @Desarlion I never gambled so yeah...It's against my nature
[11/4/18, 9:19:40 AM] <neutronbomb69> separate servers with not fake pvp
[11/4/18, 9:19:41 AM] <MalloryCat> more than 4 people in a team would be nice as well

[11/4/18, 9:19:43 AM] <Karolukas> @CohhCarnage What about speed hack?
[11/4/18, 9:19:44 AM] <Penoxi> They might want to fix the moddability as well. Someone already changed a bunch of things in the game with FO4 modding tools
[11/4/18, 9:19:44 AM] <V3gz0r> @CohhCarnage Well you just mentioned like 80% of the game...
[11/4/18, 9:19:45 AM] <lindog369> you forgot the horrible controls and how obvious of a port it is
[11/4/18, 9:19:46 AM] <Melonidas42> is he a dick to himself?
[11/4/18, 9:19:51 AM] <Domnonos> I'm still puzzled that any game company would make a multiplayer without Push-To-Talk
[11/4/18, 9:19:52 AM] <moeiscrazy> yes
[11/4/18, 9:19:52 AM] <Ghostre> cohhTOS
[11/4/18, 9:19:53 AM] <Tovarisc> @CohhCarnage How would you make game like 76 without loot respawning?
[11/4/18, 9:19:54 AM] <Attchi_> lol 76 sucks so much of course it by bethseda
[11/4/18, 9:19:54 AM] <MirthDoctor> still dunno about the no npcs and only holotapes for lore thing going on in 76
[11/4/18, 9:19:55 AM] <Thoogah> Cohh they should also remove water drinking animation and sort out the items you can sit on when you loot something on them
[11/4/18, 9:19:55 AM] <LilFighterJet> Let pple choose PvP or PvE could be an option.
[11/4/18, 9:19:57 AM] <SerenUK> There's a lot to listen to here

[11/4/18, 9:20:00 AM] <Mahakmar> aradim most will put on pacifist mode at lvl 5 , and play it as a singel player

[11/4/18, 9:20:06 AM] <aradim> Then without pvp it's just Fallout 4 with no mods
[11/4/18, 9:20:08 AM] <cocokid> go to the food table first
[11/4/18, 9:20:08 AM] <oblivion6686> if you are in power armor and you are over your normal weight limit but under the power armor weight limit you will get a "You are over encumbered" when you die and not be able to respawn near death
[11/4/18, 9:20:09 AM] <Toxikbrain> @LilFighterJet its not? so pvp is forced?
[11/4/18, 9:20:10 AM] <eENDj> @cohh have u tried basebuilding in 76 or what can u tell about it
[11/4/18, 9:20:10 AM] <septimus787> nah he loves himself

[11/4/18, 9:20:27 AM] <un_synapse> Fix the quest list. Remove 'drive by' quests, Uncap the FPS, Oh there is a ton of stiff that needs to be fixed to even consider droping $60 dollars on a 10 year old buggy as hell engine.

[11/4/18, 9:20:30 AM] <jigi5> @CohhCarnage they also need to fix al ot animations, it happens from time to time that enemies don't have an attack animation or are just permanent in T-pose mode
[11/4/18, 9:20:32 AM] <warmsumoflaps> idc fallout i only care elder scrolls
[11/4/18, 9:20:33 AM] <ZenUltracrepidarians> ??????

[11/4/18, 9:20:39 AM] <kIZZER> I mean dont you need to make it client sided then
[11/4/18, 9:20:40 AM] <babedi_bubedi> what about movement speed tied to fps in 76? @CohhCarnage
[11/4/18, 9:20:40 AM] <h1z4rd> @CohhCarnage Yes because everyone needs to get them

[11/4/18, 9:20:46 AM] <Kopus300> robots refill
[11/4/18, 9:20:48 AM] <Tovarisc> @CohhCarnage Aaaaaaaa... So they should disable respawns for certain items
[11/4/18, 9:20:48 AM] <SurfCat> pvpv in 76= you take almost no dmg when attacked until shooting back. However idk if you guys know this but when joining the "hunters channel" you get targets to kill(players)
[11/4/18, 9:20:48 AM] <ShannonZKiller> enemies also respawn it seems
[11/4/18, 9:20:48 AM] <signalerror> Also the stash and weight limits are awful, you KNOW they are going to charge you for added carry space
[11/4/18, 9:20:49 AM] <MirthDoctor> it's back for other players to loot?
[11/4/18, 9:20:50 AM] <capnshredder> @CohhCarnage i think thats so u always have junk to scrap with
[11/4/18, 9:20:50 AM] <ddavec> it needs to respawn because other people need it?
[11/4/18, 9:20:50 AM] <Beauku> its a mmo it has to respawn

[11/4/18, 9:20:55 AM] <johnygeds> it really stinks that you are rushing through this game
[11/4/18, 9:20:55 AM] <Serotriptomine> It has to respawn though?
[11/4/18, 9:20:56 AM] <Pythlyt> Yeah, multiplayer problems
[11/4/18, 9:20:57 AM] <blackmaija> whats the difference tbh?
[11/4/18, 9:20:57 AM] <Vackalak> maybe it should be a on a long timer.
[11/4/18, 9:20:57 AM] <PsychOnRails> @ShannonZKiller Yeah, it does cohhHmm
[11/4/18, 9:20:57 AM] <LilFighterJet> @Toxikbrain It's currently flag based, and the revenge system is just weird.
[11/4/18, 9:20:58 AM] <BigBadBray88> the lead weights in the gym
[11/4/18, 9:21:00 AM] <serion59> @CohhCarnage Buts in an online game...How else are other players going to be able to pick up the toilet paper?
[11/4/18, 9:21:01 AM] <rinoarose74> agreed
[11/4/18, 9:21:01 AM] <Tylerjsmith97> @ddavec well people get their own loot
[11/4/18, 9:21:01 AM] <dev_box> bronte seems like a traitor NotLikeThis

[11/4/18, 9:21:03 AM] <Dreistrich> Well it's a multiplayer game rooDerp
[11/4/18, 9:21:04 AM] <SprFstJellyfish> it's an MMO though @CohhCarnage
[11/4/18, 9:21:05 AM] <Tarenola> It's not a single player game...

[11/4/18, 9:21:10 AM] <Pseudo_Reality> @CohhCarnage then how will anyone else get it?
[11/4/18, 9:21:10 AM] <ohwey> infinit toilet paper. nice ^^
[11/4/18, 9:21:11 AM] <uk_enigma> if its a pseduo mmo its gona need the loot to respawn otherwise nobody would find shit
[11/4/18, 9:21:11 AM] <Dragonfly95> they need to client side item loot
[11/4/18, 9:21:12 AM] <Eschaap> respawning toiletpaper is actually pretty handy CohhCarnage cohhK
[11/4/18, 9:21:12 AM] <MrChiron> @CohhCarnage wasnt also the case in the last fallout??? remembered it happend to me several times
[11/4/18, 9:21:13 AM] <Bupiniak> well if there are 16 players on server it has to respawn
[11/4/18, 9:21:13 AM] <PsychOnRails> Morning @KatieCat9 cohhBlush cohhBoop cohhL
[11/4/18, 9:21:13 AM] <Melonidas42> curious if its possible that this loot doesnt respawn only for those who already got it
[11/4/18, 9:21:14 AM] <cornholio_> understand cuz it's multiplayer, totally takes you out of the world
[11/4/18, 9:21:15 AM] <garrapartida> Hi
[11/4/18, 9:21:15 AM] <oblivion6686> its a mmo if it didn't respawn it would not be there for others
[11/4/18, 9:21:15 AM] <aradim> lol Bill in a 3 piece
[11/4/18, 9:21:15 AM] <CohhilitionBot> cohhHi garrapartida says Hi to Cohh and chat.
[11/4/18, 9:21:18 AM] <Glitchedgeometry> @johnygeds he's redoing this mission for that very reason
[11/4/18, 9:21:19 AM] <xcernio> But then you would come to a point where you cant get more resources! @CohhCarnage
[11/4/18, 9:21:19 AM] <loopyNid> thats multiplayer tho
[11/4/18, 9:21:19 AM] <Serotriptomine> @CohhCarnage Loot containers are personal not shared loot. Loot in the world is free-for-all and respawns.
[11/4/18, 9:21:19 AM] <Draquta> how would u make a multiplayer other way?
[11/4/18, 9:21:20 AM] <rinoarose74> at least a time frame for respawn
[11/4/18, 9:21:20 AM] <Jameshound> @CohhCarnage Do you think it should be like account bound loot that doesnt respawn?
[11/4/18, 9:21:20 AM] <ObsidianStorm> @CohhCarnage It's not.
[11/4/18, 9:21:21 AM] <Serotriptomine> No Cohh.
[11/4/18, 9:21:22 AM] <swomppes> its not
[11/4/18, 9:21:22 AM] <logion> that's strange, because is not Fallout 76 client side? which means you play in your own world connected to other players?
[11/4/18, 9:21:23 AM] <dear_dev1l> even if its a multiplayer, the item is gone.. its gone, its probably not quest items
[11/4/18, 9:21:23 AM] <Drak0v> No its not
[11/4/18, 9:21:23 AM] <boostedharambe2> is it the same if u destroy furniture and it fixes itself after 5 minutes?
[11/4/18, 9:21:23 AM] <Dreistrich> It's not
[11/4/18, 9:21:23 AM] <Serotriptomine> @CohhCarnage Loot containers are personal not shared loot. Loot in the world is free-for-all and respawns.
[11/4/18, 9:21:23 AM] <BentOver> Cohh, if it was non spawning other players would not find it and this kind of items would be finite
[11/4/18, 9:21:24 AM] <ChrisX3M> its shared
[11/4/18, 9:21:24 AM] <Davorion100> how would other players get this stuff??
[11/4/18, 9:21:25 AM] <ItsTheKrypt> Its not
[11/4/18, 9:21:26 AM] <reborn210> no
[11/4/18, 9:21:26 AM] <ddavec> world loot isnt unique
[11/4/18, 9:21:27 AM] <m3rcer> Its not its all shared
[11/4/18, 9:21:28 AM] <Lonigus> Shared
[11/4/18, 9:21:28 AM] <TheHungryKnight> Its not unique.
[11/4/18, 9:21:28 AM] <Mighty_Rabbit_> @m3rcer HERESY! cohhOld no loot is for others but me
[11/4/18, 9:21:28 AM] <Golden_Ant> yeah it'zs "instanced"

[11/4/18, 9:21:31 AM] <Penoxi> That's all data you have to save somewhere. I don't think Bethesda wants to save hundreds of megabytes worth of loot data Cohh
[11/4/18, 9:21:31 AM] <ghorkyn> @CohhCarnage its not unique

[11/4/18, 9:21:40 AM] <TexanMD> In game items is shared, containers/corpses are instanced
[11/4/18, 9:21:41 AM] <ShadowSE1> It is not an MMO cohhFail MMO stands for MASSIVELY multiplayer. 30 players is not massive

[11/4/18, 9:21:43 AM] <ShannonZKiller> loot is unique to a player if its IN a compartment. if its out on its own tho it's shared.
[11/4/18, 9:21:43 AM] <RockoDSS> Imagine doing 4 Fallout game on the sameish engine and still having the same problems LUL

[11/4/18, 9:22:17 AM] <xXXTravmanXXx> you cant loot if it not yours
[11/4/18, 9:22:18 AM] <br3h_> Yes
[11/4/18, 9:22:19 AM] <luffy75> @CohhCarnage Only containers loot are personal yes
[11/4/18, 9:22:19 AM] <NightlyRL> @CohhCarnage Loot in the world you have to compete for, loot in containers/bodies are personal
[11/4/18, 9:22:19 AM] <DamianSdz> yes
[11/4/18, 9:22:19 AM] <darksfallen> That's why it respawns per like 45 minutes
[11/4/18, 9:22:21 AM] <tomdog89> it disappears

[11/4/18, 9:22:21 AM] <kenn357> bike and Timmac proved it, anything on the ground is far game

[11/4/18, 9:22:22 AM] <Andruisthegamer> danHmm
[11/4/18, 9:22:22 AM] <vesp1n> yep
[11/4/18, 9:22:23 AM] <ShannonZKiller> containers and quest-based loot are client side. open world items sat on their own that aren't quest based are shared.
[11/4/18, 9:22:23 AM] <oblivion6686> physical things you can see are only 1 instance
[11/4/18, 9:22:24 AM] <CptArimus> Imagine how much data you would have to track per save file to know if you as a single person loots that item
[11/4/18, 9:22:24 AM] <Beliskner666> Streamer: "Is at A or B ?" Chat: "Yes!"
[11/4/18, 9:22:24 AM] <br3h_> Not rlly
[11/4/18, 9:22:25 AM] <Toxikbrain> @LilFighterJet cant agree more
[11/4/18, 9:22:25 AM] <WhenCowsAttacK> Only containers are instanced
[11/4/18, 9:22:26 AM] <Serotriptomine> If you unlock a safe, its personal loot. If you find a special gun on the table thats in the world. Only 1 person can pick it up and you need to wait for it to respawn.
[11/4/18, 9:22:27 AM] <Tovarisc> @CohhCarnage Some items are instanced and some aren't. E.g. only 1 player in party can pick up found bobblehead and they spawn in open world
[11/4/18, 9:22:27 AM] <lucky_13SS> NO
[11/4/18, 9:22:28 AM] <gokenus> Loot should definitely be per player nad not re spawn like that
[11/4/18, 9:22:28 AM] <SkyiTV> you mean bad?
[11/4/18, 9:22:29 AM] <Thoogah> Cohh items in the world are gone gone the items looted off of containers are personal
[11/4/18, 9:22:29 AM] <outsajder21> entire F76 is a weird decision LUL
[11/4/18, 9:22:30 AM] <Shinnto> as it should, right? One drop, one pickup. Why is it strange?? @CohhCarnage
[11/4/18, 9:22:30 AM] <ShannonZKiller> yea angela and i were trying all that out
[11/4/18, 9:22:31 AM] <Duazzet> I confirmed it last night with friends
[11/4/18, 9:22:31 AM] <Va1en> I think its good
[11/4/18, 9:22:31 AM] <ShoGunGhost> @CohhCarnage have you heard the glitch when you go over 60fps the game or the player moves faster.. just the death gambit glitch
[11/4/18, 9:22:33 AM] <MrChiron> CohhCarnage it's RP sooo
[11/4/18, 9:22:33 AM] <Empiredeath86> no each have there own loot if in range and hit it
[11/4/18, 9:22:34 AM] <Darkstrifer> @CohhCarnage what game are we talking about?
[11/4/18, 9:22:34 AM] <Cylax> thats fallout for you LUL
[11/4/18, 9:22:35 AM] <br3h_> It makes sense tho
[11/4/18, 9:22:35 AM] <ThaTrooper> isnt that how real world works? :O
[11/4/18, 9:22:36 AM] <Nerzelius> the entire game is a weird decision
[11/4/18, 9:22:36 AM] <Brs2410> i kinda like that actually
[11/4/18, 9:22:37 AM] <xcernio> i think its good
[11/4/18, 9:22:38 AM] <SunlitKarma> A lot of weird decisions for this game
[11/4/18, 9:22:39 AM] <Pseudo_Reality> but the lamp respawns, thank god
[11/4/18, 9:22:40 AM] <lucky_13SS> thats not right
[11/4/18, 9:22:40 AM] <OLDxMrPink> its a big problem with fallout right there
[11/4/18, 9:22:40 AM] <Clintmaia> Its a commom MMORPG stuff
[11/4/18, 9:22:40 AM] <Shoenee> @cohhcarnage would you say that this is a western style Witcher?
[11/4/18, 9:22:41 AM] <Archon86> survive of the fitest
[11/4/18, 9:22:41 AM] <Digizz> It promotes a pvp level of survival in a way
[11/4/18, 9:22:41 AM] <An_Illusionist> So many people have no idea what they are talking about. NotLikeThis
[11/4/18, 9:22:41 AM] <ItsTheKrypt> Its a multiplayer game what do you mean?
[11/4/18, 9:22:42 AM] <capnshredder> i like it
[11/4/18, 9:22:42 AM] <PureNature> thats why the items respawn so fast @CohhCarnage
[11/4/18, 9:22:42 AM] <Tenshinyo> entire fallout 76 is weird
[11/4/18, 9:22:42 AM] <br3h_> exactly
[11/4/18, 9:22:43 AM] <Coliveve> its Multiplayer kinda
[11/4/18, 9:22:43 AM] <oblivion6686> so the first thing you do is look for BP's when you run into a room
[11/4/18, 9:22:43 AM] <SilentStormAU> weird decision and fallout 76 seem like a good combination from what ive heqard LUL
[11/4/18, 9:22:44 AM] <TooFuginBad> gotta be somehow competitive
[11/4/18, 9:22:45 AM] <Serotriptomine> Indeed. It promotes soloing and looting off on your own to get all the good stuff.
[11/4/18, 9:22:45 AM] <Mikeremeev> 90% of F76 is a weird decision
[11/4/18, 9:22:45 AM] <Aghamyr> Most stuff of importance is in containers anyway Cohh
[11/4/18, 9:22:46 AM] <Excelion_> Wait when my and my friend played yesterday - all loot was individual :O
[11/4/18, 9:22:47 AM] <acekees> muh emergan
[11/4/18, 9:22:47 AM] <Eschaap> test it tonight CohhCarnage :)
[11/4/18, 9:22:48 AM] <ohSam__> Its one big wierd decision '
[11/4/18, 9:22:48 AM] <Scouse_Mafia> co v op
[11/4/18, 9:22:49 AM] <PsychOnRails> Are they really looking for realistic tho LUL ?
[11/4/18, 9:22:50 AM] <Locklear_> yes 76 is very realistic Kappa
[11/4/18, 9:22:50 AM] <oblivion6686> those are the important things the BP's
[11/4/18, 9:22:50 AM] <Kendu_> But the PR dude on the conference said everybody can pick up the loot
[11/4/18, 9:22:53 AM] <Lazureus> so a server starts. everyone rushes for the best static loot
[11/4/18, 9:22:53 AM] <Lmntless> @CohhCarnage everyone in party gets loot from mobs killed. but not the same
[11/4/18, 9:22:53 AM] <Atherma> Why would it be different than every other survival sandbox?
[11/4/18, 9:22:53 AM] <Dolly_The_Dinosaur> You played with that lady princess and she didn’t get to loot what you looted
[11/4/18, 9:22:55 AM] <Asagaetis> I'm sure it wasn't a decision but a limitation
[11/4/18, 9:22:56 AM] <Yunaine> actually it's laziness on their part... not needing to track a million items on whether you personally looted them or not, just auto-respawn ... :x
[11/4/18, 9:22:56 AM] <septimus787> well they could implement a lottery system for teams like a need greed slider
[11/4/18, 9:22:57 AM] <Chunkylord> thats how it should be personal loot kinda boring in WoW
[11/4/18, 9:22:57 AM] <ModoMoto> Anything you can “open” is unique to you
[11/4/18, 9:22:57 AM] <Naticck> I assume its subject to change
[11/4/18, 9:22:58 AM] <CharismaticFauna> yea, I'm gonna watch Cohh play before I commit to that one
[11/4/18, 9:22:59 AM] <hakkar127> it has to be disappear
[11/4/18, 9:23:00 AM] <Empiredeath86> i was just paying last night with friends it all different loot
[11/4/18, 9:23:00 AM] <ShadowSE1> It is not a MMO guys. 30 people on a server does not make a MMO.
[11/4/18, 9:23:00 AM] <bijaytheslayer> Early bird picks up the worm i guess
[11/4/18, 9:23:00 AM] <Kendu_> the marketing guy from bethesda

[11/4/18, 9:23:12 AM] <Thoogah> to be fair it should never have been multiplayer, at least not mandatory multiplayer but that's me

[11/4/18, 10:48:06 AM] <Sleepy_Platypus> sounds like uncharted
[11/4/18, 10:48:08 AM] <NightsWarrior> Space is wifi not reall at all fact never been ther no proof
[11/4/18, 10:48:11 AM] <Modan94> yeah good choice there, Division wasnt really worth the hype
[11/4/18, 10:48:12 AM] <Skizzdog> its farming like any other game
[11/4/18, 10:48:14 AM] <AcuteJaws> Its a real grind, it didnt hit its stride until the new modes were out
[11/4/18, 10:48:14 AM] <JokersInDaHouse> Fallout 76 is exactly like Division
[11/4/18, 10:48:15 AM] <TheLordMelvin> The Division underutilized it's cover system
[11/4/18, 10:48:20 AM] <nuuriell> Kettenhobel_ it's a first-time sub; only re-subs can share a message.
[11/4/18, 10:48:22 AM] <Fulmin> I really liked the atmosphere and city of Division. Gameplay was solidly meh, like most Ubisoft
[11/4/18, 10:48:22 AM] <Mojica4life> don't use cover, hard mode
[11/4/18, 10:48:23 AM] <Penoxi> And now youre doing the exact same thing here Cohh LUL
[11/4/18, 10:48:23 AM] <natz_1019> At it's current state, DIvision 1 is pretty good in terms of how the game works around now
[11/4/18, 10:48:23 AM] <TheLordMelvin> It should have forced you to move around more
[11/4/18, 10:48:24 AM] <Kettenhobel_> @nuuriell mi that late?

[11/4/18, 10:48:31 AM] <RedBeansz> arent most games like that tho?
[11/4/18, 10:48:33 AM] <Hado4Real> Cohh never played the Survival expansion FeelsBadMan
[11/4/18, 10:48:37 AM] <metymemety> It would be a good game if it wasnt a bullet sponge simulation
[11/4/18, 10:48:38 AM] <RedBeansz> some thing multiple times
[11/4/18, 10:48:39 AM] <FMG281> division 1 looked promising at first and it kinda became boring and repetitive
[11/4/18, 10:48:39 AM] <simistrous> @CohhCarnage read the letter in arthur's room
[11/4/18, 10:48:43 AM] <SurfCat> the fact that everything is a bulletsponge and you pop tons of abilities just makes it kind of bland for me

[11/4/18, 10:50:04 AM] <Maldit0r> I feel like Fallout 76 is going to be fun to watch, I tried watching people play Division 2 but it wasn't interesting. Th at said, i have no interest in playing either game myself
[11/4/18, 10:50:05 AM] <pbrbiter> exactly. i love the fallout setting and just exploring the maps so i'm pumped for fo76

[11/4/18, 10:50:06 AM] <OpenHouseNerd> it was so close to being good, i played it for weeks and weeks but in the end they tried to revert what they did by boring game play with dlc but it never panned out
[11/4/18, 10:50:06 AM] <jarqo> This mission is amazing
[11/4/18, 10:50:07 AM] <KennyG2014> I thought division was good for its type of game

[11/4/18, 10:50:16 AM] <arrchon33> division was better at launch... they ruined it with balancing in later patches... healing got out of whack and you just ignored the cover system.... kinda the basis of the entire game
[11/4/18, 10:50:16 AM] <Ciobby98> the division has a little more to offer than that imo, but you get to enjoy it only in the "late-game" stage of the game... it's like warframe... very based of farming and farmin... actually it's how i discovered warframe.
[11/4/18, 10:50:16 AM] <KrazyShark> I freakin love Division's smooth gameplay
[11/4/18, 10:50:17 AM] <Patremagne> sadie reminds me of anne bonnie
[11/4/18, 10:50:19 AM] <IamJesterfest> I just wish Bethesda would make a sequel to Jade Empire.
[11/4/18, 10:50:19 AM] <NinjaPandaEU> So many gamers are filled with hate nowadays. Just enjoy the games you do, and let others enjoy the games they do.
[11/4/18, 10:50:19 AM] <moonscryer> i have 2400hrs in the Division. Its a great looking world but it is an insane bullet sponge you either accept the issues with or you don't play. Its better now but still has issues. It is NOT Fallout or anywhere near it.

[11/4/18, 11:06:06 AM] <Dontyellatme84> @CohhCarnage can your horse die? i want to play this but not if my horse can die lol
[11/4/18, 11:06:06 AM] <Soulcaliberx> Rockstar knows they'll make money regardless lmao
[11/4/18, 11:06:06 AM] <Vebrin> cant they turn it into a mobile game!? heared thats the new big thing
[11/4/18, 11:06:06 AM] <seranus> RDR didn't came to PC because it's code was a mess and it wasn't worth to port
[11/4/18, 11:06:07 AM] <Kettenhobel_> maybe we will se it on mobil to :-)
[11/4/18, 11:06:07 AM] <ted3959> A YEAR OR TWO????
[11/4/18, 11:06:07 AM] <Bonecrunchin> cohhF
[11/4/18, 11:06:07 AM] <Locklear_> they say they won't, so people feel forced to buy on console, then they do later
[11/4/18, 11:06:08 AM] <Pangborf> @NiorasTV not since San Andreas lol
[11/4/18, 11:06:08 AM] <DonMario23> max payne 3
[11/4/18, 11:06:09 AM] <arthasdiablo> @CohhCarnage no sirup in beer remember that cohh
[11/4/18, 11:06:09 AM] <craeshen> that and hunting can be hella time consuming
[11/4/18, 11:06:09 AM] <h0rizon_kun> Just wait years bro
[11/4/18, 11:06:10 AM] <Broheim1> Considering the money the made out of GTA V pc they prolly will. Most profitable game ever
[11/4/18, 11:06:12 AM] <SilentStormAU> @hasabey she asked you to rescue her brother and you when you did you basically got nothing from her except a thanks, this is an ex lover/gf we're talking about
[11/4/18, 11:06:12 AM] <StrangeChatwin> That seems to be Rockstars new formula. Release close to a genrations end, release on next-gen, then PC...double to triple dip potential.
[11/4/18, 11:06:13 AM] <Cbearc3431> cohhHi
[11/4/18, 11:06:14 AM] <brotherhell> @CohhCarnage depends how much copies they will sell meanwhile imo
[11/4/18, 11:06:19 AM] <pieszka> RDR 1 was never released on PC though
[11/4/18, 11:06:19 AM] <kalbeee> With how much people play GTA Online on PC that's a lot of money Rockstar will be missing out on Red Dead Online
[11/4/18, 11:06:19 AM] <xavrian> microtransactions LUL
[11/4/18, 11:06:19 AM] <GoRilla2015> @CohhCarnage rockstar will do a RdR2 Mobile version Kappa

[11/4/18, 11:06:23 AM] <shad257> @CohhCarnage why do PC releases come so much later? :(
[11/4/18, 11:06:23 AM] <HS_Noob> what is the big ?
[11/4/18, 11:06:23 AM] <zeros50> they didnt bring the first one
[11/4/18, 11:06:23 AM] <Sycamore> they would earn so much money if they were to remaster the first and sell it with this one
[11/4/18, 11:06:23 AM] <Goobzor> unlike rdr it 100% will people oped it up and found pc files
[11/4/18, 11:06:24 AM] <jigi5> @Vebrin Do you not have phones?
[11/4/18, 11:06:25 AM] <Provision_> MikeHogu current consoles are A LOT eassier to pc port then rdr1
[11/4/18, 11:06:26 AM] <cowboysfromhell55> the game look so good
[11/4/18, 11:06:27 AM] <Nutella_Fiasco> Im pretty sure RDR2 had the biggest launch in media history. They would be crazy not to release it on pc
[11/4/18, 11:06:27 AM] <Magneticall> Console player thing that Rockstar cares only about them LUL cute
[11/4/18, 11:06:28 AM] <GadiZor> they will prolly do the same thing they did with gta v
[11/4/18, 11:06:28 AM] <cryptobucks> The double / triple dipping is straight up rude
[11/4/18, 11:06:29 AM] <LBPiggy> some people actually bought GTA V twice, first to console then pc
[11/4/18, 11:06:29 AM] <Hotchiliwrap> well they sold 12 million copies in the opening weekend.. just for consoles.. so PC better be a HIT @CohhCarnage

[11/4/18, 11:06:32 AM] <Daeridium> Actually being able to aim and have sensible controls would be soooo nice. Have tried to love this game but just can not get over playing this with a controller

[11/4/18, 11:06:36 AM] <KrakeNoon> I'd bet less than a year
[11/4/18, 11:06:37 AM] <MrMxyzptlk83> There is too much money in RDR online to not release it on PC.
[11/4/18, 11:06:37 AM] <Inyobase> read dead revolver not on PC? i could have sworn it is.
[11/4/18, 11:06:37 AM] <Soulself> @NordUnion123 you think they won't do a special release of rdr1 before rdr2 release
[11/4/18, 11:06:38 AM] <Wegelius> Cohh is just cruising through these strangers
[11/4/18, 11:06:38 AM] <acekees> switch first
[11/4/18, 11:06:39 AM] <tacocatsupreme5> It's what they did with Skyrim, and that didn't come out to other platforms for like, what, 3 years?
[11/4/18, 11:06:39 AM] <alppikutka> 80€ game 5 years after original release Kreygasm
[11/4/18, 11:06:39 AM] <Archangelm> ByeBuyingPie cohhWut cohhMoney
[11/4/18, 11:06:41 AM] <naLstarkthx> since gtav is the highest earning media piece in history, i think they know what theyre doing lol
[11/4/18, 11:06:41 AM] <kofiers> We need a mobile version next Kappa
[11/4/18, 11:06:42 AM] <An_Elephant12> it 100% is getting a pc release. They just want to make sure it gets received well so it's worth
[11/4/18, 11:06:44 AM] <Souchira> I actually prefer it to be two years by that time I've forgotten most of the plot and can play it again.
[11/4/18, 11:06:46 AM] <voracious_dark> They didnt bring the first because of the coding chat FailFish
[11/4/18, 11:06:47 AM] <KatieCat9> buy it twice, cohhEvil
[11/4/18, 11:06:48 AM] <ItsTheYun> this game's earnings so far is only beaten by GTAV so I really doubt rockstar isnt gonna grab all that extra money
[11/4/18, 11:06:49 AM] <DrHax_> Cant wait to see the juicy drama if it comes to PC, just like with GTAV danSip
[11/4/18, 11:06:50 AM] <NightsWarrior> So your money driven like most
[11/4/18, 11:06:50 AM] <Bulfwyne> @ted3959 yea they have to port to PC which takes a long time too, and they'll have to touch it up and add stuff
[11/4/18, 11:06:52 AM] <SideshowBoB44> GTA5 sales still havent dropped on console tho lol
[11/4/18, 11:06:53 AM] <Lily_Cant_Dance> Just like Diablo
[11/4/18, 11:06:55 AM] <Lannovar> Cohh, there is code referencing to a PC version in RDR2 already so some have been prepped.
[11/4/18, 11:06:55 AM] <ZenUltracrepidarians> Thanks for beta testing the game cohhCrazy cohhBeer
[11/4/18, 11:06:55 AM] <cryptobucks> They'll probably wait until the GOTY version comes out to announce the PC version
[11/4/18, 11:06:56 AM] <zetx2000> pc users should boycott it
[11/4/18, 11:06:57 AM] <Fuhier> but the funny thing is the pc version of gta5 sold more than al consoles combined but lets make them wait too LUL
[11/4/18, 11:06:57 AM] <mirakhalifa1> by releasing it a year after pc release they get to absolute milk the console community and then pc players will buy the game and console players will rebuy the pc version which they will also milk the shit out of
[11/4/18, 11:06:59 AM] <lauble36> Cohh would you play wc3 campaign when remastered comes out?
[11/4/18, 11:06:59 AM] <Little_Ike> @CohhCarnage The RP community is going eat this game up, look at what they did with GTA5

[11/4/18, 11:08:30 AM] <KrakeNoon> the other option is the WB Games route where you just piecemeal another game from previous mechanics

[11/4/18, 11:08:47 AM] <NinjaPandaEU> Well, gaming has become mainstream. Of course they try that now. It's called capitalism.
[11/4/18, 11:08:47 AM] <strike121> @CohhCarnage what do you think of that?
[11/4/18, 11:08:48 AM] <Fiv3Dollar> DONT give in!
[11/4/18, 11:08:48 AM] <Nefarious_Agony> the switch is pretty much doing the same thing with skyrim and diablo, etc.
[11/4/18, 11:08:49 AM] <OneBlazingTaco> do you think there is any communication between distributors and Microsoft/Sony to potentially use the model to boost console sales as well?

[11/4/18, 11:14:23 AM] <NagaPrince> The game doesn't look that much different from Fallout 4. I think it looks a bit worse.
[11/4/18, 11:14:24 AM] <ComcastTimesMeOut> whats the consensus on PS4 vs Xbox ?
[11/4/18, 11:14:24 AM] <glenngug2> How much anyone want to bet that nothing important will change before release?
[11/4/18, 11:14:24 AM] <shawgs21> whole point of a beta is to rip it apart
[11/4/18, 11:14:26 AM] <vpathfinder> @CohhCarnage will you be doing a video on your thoughts on what they need to fix before release?

[11/4/18, 11:15:06 AM] <ValiantLoki> In regards to fallout 76, love the beta so far. I will give credit to Bethesda, they have been bug fixing alot in between beta days. Looking forward to how todays will perform

[11/4/18, 11:15:08 AM] <ZanRebel> people that hate on Fallout 76 had stupid expectations or they treat it like it's supposed to be Fallout 5 or 4

[11/4/18, 11:15:15 AM] <Phantom_Ink> @CohhCarnage do you think F76 is gonna go the way of most games these days, where they push out a buggy mess THEN slowly patch it together once they've made their money?

[11/4/18, 11:15:28 AM] <Maldit0r> The only thing I know about 76 that ruins it for me is the forced online play. Fallout is a game I want to play on my own like it's always been. But if other people like this new version, good for them

[11/4/18, 11:15:47 AM] <icp_123> At the end of the day. Here's bethesda games: It's more fun than most AAA games. Even being buggy as hell and missing a lot of features. They know how to make fun games.
[11/4/18, 11:15:48 AM] <hebustetra> on't fall in the chimney
[11/4/18, 11:15:48 AM] <Snorrev8> !
[11/4/18, 11:15:49 AM] <Souchira> The thing with many Bethesda games is that they are really really good games but technically fall short and after 20+ years of developing games they really have no excuse.
