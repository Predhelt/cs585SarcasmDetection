[09/4/18, 11:09:19 PM] <yusukes_lobsters> Lobster facts: lobsters are technically immortal. They only die naturally when they don't have the energy to keep growing and molting, which means many old lobsters die from lack of energy available through food or because they get crushed in their own shell that they can't escape from. This has been lobster facts.
