i committed some crimes in town yesterday, and if someone reports a crime, usually if you talk to the sheriff they will tell you to move along. as long as it wasn't to bad.
to add entertainment to the twitch cheers system you can now play a sound on stream with any cheers over 500! simply type "cheer500 [soundname] message" to play your sound on the stream. replace the word soundname with any of the sounds from http://sacriel.tv/cheersboard/ eg. "cheer500 [carcrash] message" then sit back and enjoy!

@champez2014 you get it 10 days early
your horse aint lookin too good partner, give it a rest.
stupid question. can you play this game in no-kill mode?
so that means the bfv release date is on 18th nov?
terrencebx you can lasso people and shoot guns out of hands. but i'd imagine there's still a lot of people you are required to kill
its a party
@champez2014 no its the 19th, and the game you can play tomorrow with origin premier
you'd probably get shot in the ass a lot, but it seems possible
you have to kill like 30 people in the tutorial lul
thanks for the answer.
19th ah ok i get u

@sacriel are you alergic to yourself ?
where are rtx settings?
how can you play?
they spend all that time building up a big mood with the intro. then you have to back out to fix the settings. failfish

ty
br isn't in until march
@nerepla350 ah alright :)
music is epic
does bfv have a single player?
why isn't it available wtf
@johnnyarks yes and no, but understandable. if you only plan on playing here and there it is good. so you can pay say $60 a year for multiple games, or pay full price for the game all at once.
march really?
has this released ?
overkill's the walking dead is out now! a four player co-op action fps, you can fight the dead...as well as the living...check it out: https://smarturl.it/sacwalkingdead
@sacriel can you show off the customization? :)
is this full release?
!highlight settings and key bindings
highlight added!
what keybinds do you use? :)
release is 15.11
@johnnyarks yes
why can sacriel play today already?
:)
it came out early.
@whisperme rdfg!
cause hes a boss
what keybinds are you using?
because of origine access prime
!rdfg
sacriel is using rdfg as his movement keys in most games so he can have access to more keys to the left on the keyboard. https://clips.twitch.tv/happyfreezingbaconprchase
!rdfg
wow this rdgf keybind idea just blew my brain up
@typehazard :)
so its 9.11. release
pretty dumb that they don't bring in key bindings from beta

@sacriel i think other tanks like the tiger will have a much bigger punch
no toast liriks
how is he playing already? still 26hours till the origin premier. or is this one of those "streamers get it first to promote"?
i dont think light tank is supposed to snipe
@sacriel could it just be "that" tank
hit registry or damage adjusting issue ?
what rounds are your tank using? beanbags? kappa @sacriel

how does a tank shell not instakill?
you literally hit a dude with a shell
yes
phy3eri read the access command i pinged on you. :)
hows the fps per seconds?
a tank is a tank can't expect a nerf from them. if u do ur s fool
that's dumb
yeah, but a direct hit should still a person
maybe the ammunition
that must be deadly hit
why can streamers play earlier?
it's fine, it's just a little metal raizc
good
type
lmao
70 ? lmao
that's dumb as hell
keep in mind bf games are arcadey, not realistic
my downloads at 30% :(
that almost looks bugged
nerf shells
that's a good thing tho
people were using the tank's mg before they even nerf it lul
a tank shell should kill wtf lul
might just be damage falloff? so that tanks actually have to move into the fight rather than snipe
wasn't there two types of ammo in tanks ?
their tank is probably at c
@sacriel can you move your cam so we can see the ammunition count?
would be a little op if all those shells one shot though
direct shell hit = 70 dmg. sounds right lul
whys he so small
at least it fires fast
@sacriel might be fall off damage and ap founds
it has a fast fire rate tho
it's literally an at gun too. this is the 40mm variant. that's some big ass bullet for 70 damage
dansmile just getting hit directly by a explosive shell, no prob.
better off just using the aux
im glad tanks cant snipe easy kills from far away now. its was stupid in bf1

the germans are absolute units, imagine taking a tank shell to the body forsenkek
phy3eri i dont have that answer. youll have to ask ea.
a tank shell should blow the body into million pieces
im sorry but am i the only one that thinks it would be really cheesy if a tank can sit in the back of the map and oneshot you?
they should make it that direct hits still kill, but keep the explsion and splash damage as it is now

you want immersion!? open mics dood. that's how you feel really apart of the world
i think the tank shells deal less damage, so one can't spam them against infantry. timps
there's a tank in my living room!
who gave sacriel a driving license
anybody home 4head
very nice :d
lets talk about the realism of picking someone up after they just got lit up by a ton of bullets
at the drive in!
@pigl33t lul
decrease the rof and increase the damages thats easy
valentine coming through ♿
sac just comes in for tea with a tank 'don't mind me'
u guys see that guy knifing the other guy next to sac?
why decrease rof
it's fine as it is
the center walls of building are made of the same thing as infantry uniforms. invulnerable to tanks.
parked the tank in living room rofl lul
cant u rearm at c ?
this is battlefield, not arma 3. don't expect too much realism and common sense
it says 2 pdr so if historial it is ap only.
can't see shit, the video game. cynicalaward
g'mornin' folks sac42pride
just curious..why is ther a womans voice giving directions in the game? there werent woman line officers in ww2

all the cod kids in school hating on bf lul
beta prerelease enjoy lul
but it does look good, im sure theyll fix the majority of bugs
@rchardkuklinski say 1 game that never got any bug or problems the first day of "release"
one of the devs tweeted about scope glint, it is definitely back and is definitely brighter for higher power scopes.
!access
+1 on lemings
anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
so what exactly do you think caused that?
people who can play today actually paid less.. timpsmart
ohhhhh bf5
some of yall are so toxic, it shows whats wrong with todays gaming community notlikethis
every game has weird bugs, nothing new
@fluffyabsol 15$ per month isn´t really cheap ...
you going to snipe the crap out of people
can you not browse the servers?
where the rest of your kingsmen today?
i want bfv immortal :)
well that answers that
@nhaezer oh i’m sorry i forgot to insert my sarcasm because people online get way too offended nowadays lul hey guys i was being sarcastic in my previous message in chat fyi failfish
sniping was so satisfying in this game though
show us tank upgrades :d
@murphy1rng get a job and it's cheap
the snipe changes in beta were amazing, why did they revert it?
maybe remove all maps
they should at least add an item where you can remove it.
they make 10kw light bulbs?
why did they not have it in the open beta and then add it in afterwards, thats what i hate
its bf they nerf everything!
@exczist well i got a job, so your argument has no value.
remove sniper it's easier lul

there wasnt any scope glint when you played earlier no?

oh man, oh man
just restrict the snipers per team
@sacriel you cant go off 1 persons word research it and see if it true
ew, they're adding the sniper glint back?
@sacriel turn on killfeed? and move your head to the left a bit
they could've just put like a scope mesh onto the weapons via attachments to removve flare. why do they need to havve it persistant and brighter than before.

you now have kill log: hide

@rchardkuklinski don’t talk shit and get offended when someone says something back lul
what's up
kill log is still off
missed it
it says kill log hide or show peebroderp
you skipped over kill log show
@sacriel kill log: show
kill log still turned off
@sacriel you need to click show on kill log
@sacriel i think you have to set the kill log to "show"

how does the game feel?

hatefuldread, anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
well @nhaezer my first message about pushing the release date back and still can’t get it right was all sarcasm... i’ve been playing the bf franchise since bf modern combat 2 on the ps2. lulz lul
@murphy1rng then stop wase money on stuff .. i have 3 game cards on wow and i earn abit over 28k per month and thats not so much compare to others
so in bf1 the marksman scopes didnt have scope glint. is that still true for bfv?
@omacbeth he just started
lul
is the br mode of this game is already released?
show kill log @sacriel was an option besides what you want to see on the kill log option.
ah so its just premier?, i have basic sadly
guns bigger than it so prob not
@xjumb0 not yet
its a bit big i think
@omacbeth the game feels like cold pizza. hope that helps
lul
@bumrushbill glint is back for now
that guns too big for a bike bruh
lul cheeky one
@xjumb0 march next year ma dude
@rchardkuklinski in that case, pardon me
does this game only have one map? lul
i actually think the best kill log setting is my squad, it's that a possibility
some you can some not
@aottospeanuts you're a cold pizza.
stugging
it should have 8 :d
@pigl33t yeah but for all scopes? in bf1 glint was only there for the sniper scopes, not the marksman scopes
@killwin so far he's gotten rotterdam and this map twice
i was killed by a shingle
wutface
@omacbeth [oo](_|\.)[oo]
@exczist 28k per month isnt much per month? in which world do you live?
you'd think they'd show this map less xd

@bumrushbill no idea what the difference would be between them since snipers are marksmen?? but sac saw a guy with a glinting scope before
weird
so dumb, i feel like weapons should be faction locked
waittill sac finds birds. he'll kill them and steal their feathers.

@frozyeso no, you don't. you would if you got the deluxe edition, which i got myself, and i got cucked by ea (surprise) with 15th november being the release date. so basically i paid almost one year worth of origin access premier for a single game, and yet people who paid ten times less get to play a week earlier

@frozyeso exactly what i'm saying. most of those people will stop playing within the month and cancel their subscriptions
i guess you are in a server with this map only
ohhhh right
thank you @sleipnyr
remind me of karkand swimming back flank kappa
@superocrates medium settings
anyone have issues joining servers in bf1? curious if those problems would continue in bfv for me.

nhaezer when you cancel your subscription it asks for your feedback on why you did it, and the last option is "i subscribed for early access to a game" saclul
sac, remember you adjust your color blind settings so you can see the markers easier
do you keep progression ?

@sacriel i have origins primer but dont see the option to play this now? it still shows 1 day 1 hour and 37 minutes before its available to play
i wonder if they just threw a rubber spider at the voice actors to get death screams.
sirrusc not really, i can't get it out of my head that my teacher looks like a dwarf from ironforge sacawk
im downloading my 10 hour trial right now i think everyone can play right now with ea access

did that spitfire know to fly low for dramatic stream?
do i have to buy the game in order to play it for 10 hrs? @chat
anyone know the size of the download? 44gb for the trial doesn't seem like much?
sac is saving the lllladies.
@sacriel time to get the support's double barrel shotgun? the one with the rifle round in the bottom

m-30 drilling i think it was called
@ミッチ well its only 8 maps now usually its 80 gigs after all dlc come out
sometinspecial sac7
@muckeastwood no, you need to have origin access, the basic version works
@ミッチ what do you mean by trial? if you mean the 10 hour trial you still need to download the full game
@lemings isn't that a triple barrel shotgun?
thought early access premier is nov 9th?
is this closed beta?
@ミッチ the game is 50gb-ish.
@nhaezer so the full game is only 44gb then...
mrsirundersteer sachmm
yea the triple barrel shotgun
@cprivy they moved it to today.
mmm yes, that drilling was fun in beta
@dragoonseal he had to reduce to medium with his monster of a pc? that doesn't sound promising ://

!access
anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
44gb iirc
is firestorm not part of the launch? just wondering how well they pulled off battle royale
even the standard edition can be pre loaded tho
sounds just like a real headshot seemsgood
@lemings like, it had 2 shotgun barrels, and then the rifle barrel tucked between and below the 2 shotgun barrels
@ミッチ wouldn't call it "only" 44gb, but yea, that's it
chris121580 firestorm will be in march as far as i know
d. timpw
@hydroxcs mind you he's also streaming from this pc, and he was getting 144+ fps, he was just getting occasional drops

@lemings if we're gonna get technical then technically, it's a multi caliber firearm, not a shotgun only, nor is it a rifle only. it's got both. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@mrsirundersteer its a side by side with a rifle barrel under the main barrels.

@blehmehandeh you could land planes in bf3/4 as well, so it would be weird if they didn't let you land planes on this title as well
planes had flares in ww2??
they should have included airfields in the game, so you can land to resupply and repair aircraft. bit silly being able to repair whilst flying

@idolen_ premier is today as well
best answer @sacriel u just questioned every word in the question xd
@microchaton yup
@idolen_ yes but i think it opened today as a surprise. don't think this is streamer specific
this map is dope
@bigtiddybawls feels like it, especially after the weekly reset. so many activities!
u.s. and u.k. i believe had a few differences in our codes as well back then
@madtown_maverick insane, so people get to play 1 week before actual supporters, for the development of the game.
skill gap is pretty high in this game compared to bf1. jackfrags had a lot of good things to say about the gameplay
@idolen_ i can play it as well and i don#t strema.

repair, it's in the name.
@trivialmind no, just in general, movement is slower paced. but it has different maps, whereas vermintide is always "go go go", otwd has some maps where it's just survive the horde

@arrayarc the game has hdr, it comes through on the stream just fine. when he's in a dark room and walks out into the sun it's bright and washed out for a few moments. but the effect looked pretty gross on this map for some reason
how good/bad is the game so far?
what does that mean lol ?
if you have origin access then yeah you can play it already
so i am completly out of the loop here, doesn't bfv release on 20th??
it's the volk sturmgewehr i think
twisted steel, or somehtinmg like that
@sacriel are you doing an integration today?
oh he's not playing medic, that gun looked like a submachine gun

!premier
makes sense, dont need to parralel park a plane, heyoo...
@arrayarc it's literately called hdr in the options. and it's been in games for like 10 years. it's not as good as the true hdr you can get from monitors that support it these days, it's just an aproximation of the effect. never looks particularly great, some games do it better than others
translation “i eat ass”
it sounds more like a german boy (maybe hitlerjugend?)

germans in chat swiftwell

@scottmey2001 that’s squad revive not a normal revive

@yorkshiregold roovv
historical accuracy in bfv pog
i like how sac just puts a u in reticle :p
@sacriel it is made for the shape of a tank
📝 rooisee
bracket target in center piece
maybe it's for when you're on a hill and it's to aim when the camera is tilted @sacriel
size of tank.? to judge distance?
seqfeels
when an enemy tank matches the silhouette youhave the right range
i think the middle thingy is "tank standing towards you" as the center
derp gun
clap
that thing is meant to destroy structures 😡
its a picture of a bunker you use it like mill dots if somone is 2 bunkers away you shoot at their feet kappa
range markers on the right windage built in
jebaited
it looks like an oldschool artellery
@sacriel have to line it up with the tank's shoulders.
@fambaa oh yea that makes sense
if the zeroing is accurate, i don't think it's a bad reticule
fun detected feelsbadman

outline of a tank. if they fit into it they are that far away. reminds me of vss scope in pubg

why would it be spelled with a ü? makes no sense
@wallytreats its kinda new
okay sounds great, thanks :d
most powerful console. good joke
@sacriel what res are you playing on?
is this still in beta?
@shannonzkiller take it easy, that young idi ... i mean that nice little creatures are our future rooderp
@jarmoest ea origin access has been out for 3 yrs
the music kreygasm
is origin access premier costly?
@mulface no, this is full release
@shannonzkiller thanks but i thought premier can acces on friday lirikthink
those eyes sacpog
ty
@dexsleik it is the worlds most powerful console, its just shit
colony92 yea they changed it totally on surprise today
@mulface no the beta is over but the game is out early on pc
@teresmajor one is i think, a bolt rifle
@colony92 they moved it to today.
@sacriel type “lul” (as in the twitch emote lul ) in to google. the auto detect translation is hilarious.. 😂
clearly not 4head
@comatose24 isn't release on 16?
@wallytreats its premier tho
5 years, not 6
@adrianbrown sweet, i got one irl, i didnt expect them to add it in this game though
coolmusicguy yea full normal reelease is that day, but ea access peeps get it early
back out
@sacriel how do you predict the launch will do?
@jarmoest ah gotcha, ok gg ya got me
wait this is full release lol a whole 2 weeks early huh
still can't swap teams..?
@shannonzkiller oh thank god! i was so bored with games... was waint gfor tomorrow! colonyhype
lol no team switching :d
you could switch in the beta right?
it encourages teaming up before the game and discourages just team swapping to the winning team
try to invite him through origin

but why didn't they put you on the same team even though you were in a squad before the game?!
@iyield2no1 sac7
@iyield2no1 sac7
is this full release or just late beta?
you can switch teams if you have a friend on the other i side i heard the devs say in a stream
"that's a bad feature..." - battlefield, the series!
that map looked beautiful
@s0journer full release
cyb00rg two weeks early... but technically still two weeks late. originally they said the game was going to be out late october
team switching has always been a bf issue..
biker
so im guessing no team balance?
!access
anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
i think to make up for it they should add the option to choose a preferred faction.
@s0journer full
i think it's an understandable change
it makes sense to remove it but you need a way to join with friends
team switching is a huge problem in bf1, thank god
!42nd
they should make it so it only restricts changing to the winning team. people on the winning team can still swap to the losing one
the 42nd comes from chris' youtube name sacriel42. the 42 comes from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. when the community here started to get bigger we chose to call ourselves the 42nd. read more here: http://sacriel.tv/the-42nd/
@s0journer tomorrow is official full release
c'mon sac.. that makes to much sense.. sheesh
is he playing with stod?
sacriel always got a solution lol
yes
sac your such a captain heinsight lol

doobyscoo newsflash: fps games aren't only about br, especially battlefield

no access here
br’s in 2019 lul
sick and tired of br its a good thing they delay it
is bfv worth the money?
not sure on that unicornbrothels
origin premier is actual worth btw if you're gonna play more than 1 origin game
grand operations?? cool

car-bean
@uzziuri $100 dollars a year and i already have 2 deluxe versions of games worth 70+ dollars? that's worth.
@shannonzkiller when are you guys moving into the new place?
there’s so many people asking how he’s playing this game right now, i feel there should be a banner on the bottom of the screen to explain lul
hello sacwave
if you want to say it like a 'murican, you gotta say "car-bean"

yea not having the battle royale for 5 months is a mistake i think
@ionone medium
my only issue with battlefield is every match is always one sided
is this just a bit of wood nailed to some steel?
medium.
so i already own battlefield 5 deluxe edition, can i buy premier to play today anyways ?
medium graphics i believe
can you hide in a grass or in a bush in this game properly?
funny you hook up to a static line then also do an animation for pulling a parachute

jesus chat today is a fucking mess
!access blue_fist75 it came out early mate
blue_fist75, anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
does sac have raytracing enabled?
@lemings the poor lack of communication and misleading information. also the very negative response they got from the general public and fans of the game.
i have a question about origin premium... do you have to buy the game to play early or by just paying the monthly amount you get the game?
hilfe !!!!!
get some bombs dude
put them on a and d
destroy the objectives :d
has there been good changes since the last beta?
@dragoonseal well i have premier and i didint get it
@ponssek you only get to play early if you own it
this doesnt look very fun
@dragoonseal ah thats good, literally the betas best gun haha

@shellshock012 oi*
"das ist zwei helfen" "that's two help" lmao
i’m out of the loop. did this game fail as bad as everyone was saying it would?
tarkov- fresh wipe... you down @sacriel
who is playing with a kazoo?
this feelin any different?
i promise i will play medic!!!!!!
boil em mash em stick em in a stew
@miseryarse we saw you and therefore you are and will stay as a stream sniper in our books forever. no matter what you do kappa lul
i love maps without vehicles
cheer100
lol
is it only me or the arm model looks so strange?
!squad
sacriel is currently playing with stodeh.
did i hear a fart sound? lol
i'd play medic - my aim isn't the best
stodeh probs plays with a kazoo.
vicious_dude sac7
doobyscoo lack of communication? no idea what you mean, they said a bunch of things about the game beforehand. misleading information? you mean people wanting something, expecting it as confirmed, then when the game comes out and it's not in because the devs never said anything like it they are butthurt? negative response from the general public? you mean those kids shouting -banned word- based on the very first trailer like some 10years olds?
@miseryarse sacclassy sacbros
that was a quick round
whats wrong with medic guns?
@vicious_dude sac7
po ta toes
i play medic usually did they nerf them or something?
@andreah2o i hate every vehicle lul
our cq server just crashed
or give medic better guns?
fluffyabsol lol
no more run and gun smoketvrip
i bet you can build them
@sacriel how are you liking the new battlefield so far? think it was worth the delay?
its a bit odd to me when it moves, invictusaie
oh wth
you can build stations
gj dice
play a support like a medic to win not kill...
@jizzsocks best. name. on. twitch. 😂
so the medic guns are peashooters basicly?
@sacriel instead of "das ist zwei helfen" it's "das sind zwei gesundheit"
high preset kreygasm
i will be nnpm: never not playing medic
this is my oath
thats battlefield... if they had great guns then everyone would play a medic....
@sacriel squad leaders can drop in resupply capsules
maa drains ur fps
did they nerf the sten from the beta? cause you could do alroght at mid range with that
hacksaw ridge it and don'tt use a gun
@lemings preach. timplove
@lemings it wasnt mislead information it just wasnt what we expected or wanted from the next entry in the bf franchise especially given the fact ww2 is a pretty sentitive atmosphere to just completely change.
looks a lot better
wait what? battlefiled is out??? wut? lirikhmm lirikthink lirikp
are there performance issues?
they gave assults battle rifles or somethign stupid didnt they
same map different mode?

@the_seventh lol why does lirik have so many thinking emotes
@lobnob_ there is not nvidia driver yet so does it matter?
don't tar me as a stream sniper - as soon as i realised i was in their server i quit. certainly wasn't intentional - there arent that many servers to go on with a low ping
center chest like john wick
@sacriel check motion blur settings, make sure it didn't turn back on
center chest is better
@shannonzkiller i think sac is doing gangnam, again.
can you turn on fps counter?
coffee is way better than tea. can't change my mind kappa
rtx off feelsbadman
fluffyabsol oh god... old school
sounds is 10/10
so... hiding in a ditch?
@sacriel special forces kind of keep it flat to their stomach if they're clearing buildings
@pecky95 i just got the nvidia drivers
complaining about realism in a viddy game is pretty silly imo. not everything has to be a simulation
cynicalfps
@lemings there were multipule occasions when they said things would or wouldnt be at launch and it was the opposite. there have been so many negative things about the game so far.
@sacriel turn off maa
how to play it today?
winterwolfeu sensitive atmosphere? so what about those many games which covered ww2 in the past? cod2, bf1942, day of infamy. those weren't magically cried about for being ww2
oof
darkpuppet97 i am with you. tbh.
62 on a monster rig wutface
62 feelsbadman
@pykseldot yeah but its just more of the fact every ww2 game so far has had pretty much the same atmosphere, going against that with such an iconic game that would fit the era is just weird.
rtx on btw lul
vsync monkas
you gots dat rtx on?
@lobnob_ y and it might make the game run so much better that whatever is happening for him does not matter
@kleiklei got me.. no idea.:d ... q for him :-) do you know how sac playing b5 already? beta or what?
oh nice
vsync terrible input lag dansgame

@winterwolfeu i don't disagree that i was hoping they would go more modern with the franchise for this next installment but that doesn't immediately make it a bad game.
that’s nice
much better
@lemings world at war was in the thick of wwii and nobody complained. cynicaldead
@shaddydashadow he has vsync off. just has the fps capped is all
darkpuppet97 my favourite types are usually rich espresso blends. i like a slightly coocay flavour
lul
i would have liked to see modern as well, but im not toooo mad about the ww2 setting and taking some liberties with it
what is this fight lul
@dragoonseal he just turned it off?
doobyscoo if there are so many, then tell me what! give me examples! they said vehicle visual customization won't be in at launch, and lo and behold, it's not in
sackill
how can he play now? premier gets it at 5 pm tommorow?
fluffyabsol yeah exactly
@lemings not to mention the boring single player
@lemings cod2 bf1942 never went to the "lesser" known battles and decided to make the battlefield consist of 50% females or completely skip d-day. bfv skipping d-day completely for what purpose? showing narvik and norway's involvement?
@shaddydashadow he never turned it on
@nuugi i quit as soonn as i realised i was in their server didn't real;ise till i heard my name and then quit immediatley.

doobyscoo black ops 4 has no singleplayer, i don't see people boycotting it because of it
only snipers can spot right ?
@dragoonseal dunno just saw him in the settings and it was on and saw him turn it off
is this a us loadout playing german?
eh singleplayer isn't that bad, gives the people who are terrible at multiplayer some practice at least
is it me or do the animations look cheap

cod was never campaign oriented though. dice never pulled off a decent campaign
@lspn you're watching him play, right? :)
@flusha_lmao compared to what?
hey guys do you think your enemy should drop the health pack if he has one when he dies?
1hp pog
@winterwolfeu you know that this is time-line based, right? america isn't in the game, yet.
@nuugi no checking lists when i sign in 3 times its put me back in their game i'm quitting each time. might wait till later to play as it's an issue
@lemings thats a different game and it has a battle royale. i'm saying the single player in this game that they used resources on is rubbish
ja, why not
42 hp
@pecky95 bf1
@shaddydashadow when it put it on the high preset it reset some options like motion blur and such, that he turned back off again. i didn't see if vsync was one of them.
first and last medic in the world
@comatose24 yes, but on origin it says in 1 day, countdown on origin
winterwolfeu so what? you some incel or something? it's an alternate history, get over it. and nobody said they will miss d-day. this is early in the war, d-day was a lot later. and it will most likely be in later on as part of the tides of war
@fluffyabsol extremely unlikely that d-day is in the game given the fact it hasnt been marketed or even mentioned despite being one of the most iconic moments in history.
ha,
@dragoonseal oh ok i just joined in at that moment so lol
nasty!
its an ultra rare shiny medic
@winterwolfeu so i guess you never played the first cod ;d of course it was campaign based
@sacriel new eft patch and wipe today, you gonna be jumping into it again this wipe?
@miseryarse welcome to the twitch (chat) lul
how do you think the m1a1 carbine handles @sacriel
wups
*flop*
that was a great pistol head shot when you turned that corner
go sniper?
@lemings it takes just a quick scroll through any battlefield youtubers videos to see all the problems.
if you're not a medic, you don't get to complain about there being no medics, imo
i like this map wasnt this one in the beta?
@winterwolfeu they haven't marketed any american involvement, yet.
beta??
@lemings it was never marketed as alternate history, it was marketed as showing the lesser known "facts" of the war. youre calling me an incel over the internet on a twitch chat? i wonder who's one lmao hostile much
so crap??
i've always liked the word carbine. satisfying word.
@sacriel early release?
@doobyscoo so you're basing your feedback on heresay, thereby propagating the problem.
d-day has been done to death, who cares. i'd rather do something different
uhhh the garand
could you have picked a less important thing to arge about? good lord get lives.
@winterwolfeu it was marked as their take on ww2
winterwolfeu lemings cmon guys..
marketed*
so the changes they made from beta, how are they?
@nuugi been a member for a while now lol
this gun seems really weak
not everyone wants to relive their childhood until the end of time
thst looks sick if you get in cover
@connatic id love a dday operation..
so many
buy or nay?
@connatic so because the initial cods were campaign based over a decade ago that makes the entire franchise invested in it? the multiplayer has been the go to selling point for many many years, skipping a campaign was a decision they made because it wasnt profitable to keep based on the past 3 entries.
holy shit
@sacriel do you think the enemy should drop the health pack they have when they die, that could solve the low heath issue a bit
that animation was... odd
the movement system makes firefights way more interesting
saclul sacbros
winterwolfeu no, it was marketed as "showing the lesser known battles of ww2". don't change facts to your advantage. and yes, in general only those people have this obsession against women
@connatic would you rather have call of duty gameplay with silly little jetpacks and too futuristic shits
don't make mommy shannon separate you.
this girl screams wutface
@shannonzkiller im arguing about a point he's just insulting me lmao
lol winterwolf is so mad about viddy games
@typehazard i think they do?
how is he able to play 1 day before release?? strreamerthing?

no arguing about the game. take it to reddit

hey @dragoonseal hi
@connatic @winterwolfeu take it to whipsers please, or else move on and enjoy watching the gameplay.
@dragoonseal thanks mate ^^
oh wow you're actually able to fix your plane and turn now
have the flying mechanics been improved since the beta?
wait wasnt this place in post scriptum as well?
@caseysbro what are you talking about? just saying, every ww2 game doesn't have to be about d-day
cheer10 is the flight control similar to battlefield 1 or battlefield 3/4 ?
@ryanmakhoul they added a campaign to try to compete with other shooters that pulled off decent campaigns at the time (modern warfare 2, black ops 1) but never succeeded with a very well received one
@sacriel how's the flying feel? i would imagine not changed much from previous incarnations.
why do people argue just stop and watch the game nobody will gain anything from this
fly through the bridge
wow the controversy over what timeline or weather its gonna show d-day this game looks sick and i just wanna play it, leave all your arguing at the door and just watch the epic game play
ow.
the flak is real
winterwolfeu we have a rule against arguing especially over controversial crap and politics. best suited to reddit, thanks! lemings, leave the insults out. you know better sacno
@typehazard i thought he'd picked up a couple, but maybe they were ammo packs and i'm a blindo
the plane shooting blanks or what
hey chat is this an early release @sacriel

@atraaaax sac7
some of you need to scream into a bucket, or something. timpw
isn't it progressing through the war chronologically but taking liberties with weapons and equipment? so we're at 1939/40 now meaning a d-day map may come once we get round to 1944 in the freelc?
what are the flares for?
@connatic more of technicalities. multiplayer wasnt really a thing in 2002 lol
shannonzkiller okay mom sacthump i need to finish my ramen and get to class soon anyways sacawk

wow ur flying at mk 4 or something

its a business lul
@jarmoest i mean on actual release though, don't think ill get it on premier
instead of 60 bucks. ea is so bad. timpw
if you have the deluxe version preordered, ive been told you can sign up for premiere, play early, cancel, and all your stats and progress carries over to the version you already own
pestimism you dont need to buy the game, just have acess for 12
doesnt premier bf release tomrow?
so is that a panzer 4 without a heavier cannon the later models had?
i have deluxe edition with orgin premier
@sacriel make one, call a resuply in on ur position @sacriel

sirrusc i only gotta start getting ready in 10 minutes, class doesn't start until 50 minutes from now
bahoney check here https://www.battlefield.com/news/battlefield-5-play-with-premier
most companies would use a aaa game to promote a new subscription service if they could.
woops didnt mean to do it twice xd
might be a panzer iii
ramming speed.
graphical downgrade from bf1
@topguyz its like they are a business or something
thats good. not op that way
supports carrying tank shells saclul
@bahoney it realeased day early
no tank camp, i'm ok with it xd
@came_too_quick lul
tatt support which can carry tank ammo should get a medal :p
no this is better, tanks are op in other bf's
@majorfoley yea the 4 didn't have an 88 but there is a later model with a longer barrel
@sacriel maybe try supply drop? from the plane
what about the supply drop thing you did earlier?
@came_too_quick wut?
@killerkadoffel nah it did say panzer 4 so i am gonna assume the anti infantry models back before they gave em longer barrels
i like it. i like attrition and ammo not being as prevalent
it's destroyed
it's dead, sac.
build the station
need to build station
@sacriel might need to repair the station as a support
its not built
people defending ea in chat lul
is this with rtx??
yeah i like it too @bloodba7h
thanks, just confused. it says 9th november
lol i just saw they added your tea in tarkov lul
@originaltimeline yeah the tigers were the original tanks with 88s and i think the panzer 3s had 76s didnt they? early pivs were infantry support tanks
camping tanks with unlimited ammo in 2018 lul
lul
no @motodriv3r
pestimism people having complaints based on nothing in chat lul
stopsyeah how can support carry tank ammo?????
is this closed beta?
@pestimism take it to reddit. we don't want arguments here
the importance of teamplay. nice
@ryanmakhoul graphics look awful compared to bf1
@pestimism "ea bad"
"defending ea" over game-mechanics, ok dude
@pestimism im still hyped for bf5 battle royal
ea access is good imo
@veetux this is "pre-release access" with origin access
stops you from spamming from affar

everyone using bttv/ffz katielul
@majorfoley you're correct sir
that wall is indestructible
@came_too_quick well this is a video you know... beta of bfv looked better than bf1 for me
@cookii and thats your choice
j0shy___ yea i thought that was funny too

can you destroy that bunker?
daymmmmmm
lul
@hattyqt just get orgin premier and u will have access to deluxe edition
window shots
bouche4dag it was rare they got destroyed because they were very durable saclol
@bouche4dag support builds faster.
@sacriel before this game was released, i remember them saying you’d be able to attach ammo / health crates to your tank and move them around the map. is that an actual thing you can do??
d:
i did know that ;) @fluffyabsol
sac just farted on that guy.
dickhead? d: rude
how can he play already?
can you steal enemy tanks in this game?
how is he able to play today? i have premier and i cant play
bouche4dag they took like 5-6 direct hit tank shots before they got destroyed
no destruction is a bf notlikethis
@lemings they were blown up super quick in the beta :o
wait, how do you play bfv?
so you need to get premier to play it now>?
what a dickhead
@j0shy___ yes.
@mysfitt relaunch your origin
mhxgod yep
@smo0kyjoe origin premier
bouche4dag hmm... sachmm
this looks so good
thanks :)
he has bfv because he plays on pc and bought the premium version
so can i play this now with premier? because there is a 24 hour countdown on ea origin.
@majorfoley yea any panzer 2, no clue what variant
what does 42nd base mean? can someone lighten me up please?
if you backed up 2 centimeters too far you blew it up :/ @lemings
hmmm - stream wont play for me? says offline
@lemings will basic work?
early access i suppose
!42nd @lumpenrorsarch
lumpenrorsarch, the 42nd comes from chris' youtube name sacriel42. the 42 comes from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. when the community here started to get bigger we chose to call ourselves the 42nd. read more here: http://sacriel.tv/the-42nd/

mhxgod basic will get you 10 hours until release. premier is unlimited
sac doesnt like other people having ammo...
lul
sacfa
@originaltimeline i dunno what my fav tank is, i did like the 85 variants of the t-34

krownax check here https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-11-08-looks-like-battlefield-5-is-available-even-earlier-than-expected
early access :)
it went live early than expected
is this early access because of pre purchase?
game is out @krownax
go sacriel go !!
so what's the verdict? buy this or hodl?
@nolanist he's only on high presets, so that might be it

@turbotraktorgaming its the map\
@sandown2_0 cheers
it still looks like a re-skinned bf1 to me
@krownax enjoy the rest of the day. saclove
@murasaur it does feel different (much better imo)
man i wont understand some people...people see colors in war games and they freak out
@sandown2_0 ahh cool
@xelipsis i would say if you already have the origin access premium thing you already have it, i would stick with bf1 tbh.
start crying fortnite..lul
graphics look really fucking clean though
you can run while proned? thats awesome
that is a thicc gun
@came_too_quick i believe it’s not just streamers for today. it’s everyone. they bumped it forward a day if you refresh it
add break @sacriel ? pogchamp
to add entertainment to the twitch cheers system you can now play a sound on stream with any cheers over 500! simply type "cheer500 [soundname] message" to play your sound on the stream. replace the word soundname with any of the sounds from http://sacriel.tv/cheersboard/ eg. "cheer500 [carcrash] message" then sit back and enjoy!

@larrycordner the absolute unit

@ryanmakhoul so a faster time to kill is the only fundamental difference - and there aren't any 1 shot snipers in bf1 - unless a headshot which should be a 1 shot kill anyway

wtf
sachurt
nice easy way to farm xp lol
@came_too_quick asking someone to outline a fairly lengthy list of improvements only here in chat is just silly. educate yourself. :)
@axisbond no 3d spotting, unless you use the spotting scope like he is now
it's crazy how you can't single spot the enemy like bf1
#iamdoingmyparty
ur spotting: not nothing ;d
literally jsut become eye of sauron lul
i know how i am farming 4head
pogchamp sweet looking skills
oh you are one of those white hands who told others what to do and you take all the credit arsonnosexy kappa
end of game top of leaderboard with no kills? xd
saciq saciq saciq
@sacriel so they are spotted on the mini map right? not 3d spotted
i guess it is the only way to encourage people to do it
it has been this way since bf3 though... just sitting far away spotting
spots on the mini map only right?
