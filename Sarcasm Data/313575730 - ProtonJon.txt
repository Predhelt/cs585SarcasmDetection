[09/22/18, 10:44:55 PM] <powerprotoman> But which b button will you press
[09/22/18, 10:44:56 PM] <legion_immortal> @caliatom pretty much
[09/22/18, 10:44:57 PM] <UltaKi> Differences in difficulty?
[09/22/18, 10:45:00 PM] <disgaea_demon_overlord> @Kuuribro Hit enter too soon. So, I've played a fair bit of a Fire Emblem. Is that good enough?
[09/22/18, 10:45:02 PM] <UltaKi> Curious on that
[09/22/18, 10:45:02 PM] <Just_some_dude12> @xilehnoc Did you find out who stole that tree?
[09/22/18, 10:45:02 PM] <Kidd_Decibel> https://store.steampowered.com/app/790820/Valkyria_Chronicles_4/ Release date: Sept 25th. $60 USD. Denuvo Warning, for those that care about it.
[09/22/18, 10:45:06 PM] <XenoDanganMonicals> Well shit, good job Jon *goes to get my copy of Valkyria Revolution*
[09/22/18, 10:45:08 PM] <kaidoi94> It's just damage taken from enemies @UltaKi
[09/22/18, 10:45:09 PM] <SirIliumIschium> What happens if you set all control options to the same thing?
[09/22/18, 10:45:10 PM] <DarkPitStain> @tenmar Actually, I think 3 is the only one that never saw an international release
[09/22/18, 10:45:11 PM] <SweetieAsh> Also, only VC game we never got out of FIVE is just VC3.
[09/22/18, 10:45:11 PM] <DismalDimwit> ugh, only 90fps? That's barely even watchable Kappa
[09/22/18, 10:45:13 PM] <The_goddamn_gameman> but... the flowers...
[09/22/18, 10:45:16 PM] <Kuuribro> @disgaea_demon_overlord fire emblem's a close comparison, yeah.
[09/22/18, 10:45:17 PM] <SweetieAsh> We got every other one.
[09/22/18, 10:45:17 PM] <Koori18> Sir reporting in SIR
[09/22/18, 10:45:17 PM] <CityofCyn> I love how the mouth look like fish
[09/22/18, 10:45:18 PM] <UltaKi> Gotcha
[09/22/18, 10:45:18 PM] <XenoDanganMonicals> Hey Keith Silverstein
[09/22/18, 10:45:20 PM] <CeIebiSon_M> @xilehnoc also today is the one-year anniversary of a certain game that was featured on Grumps.
[09/22/18, 10:45:21 PM] <Camille_skyloft> I do love the esthetic of this game. I like the old photo/drawing effect.
[09/22/18, 10:45:22 PM] <CounterpointClover> He's not in One Piece. Different series. :P
[09/22/18, 10:45:22 PM] <indignantdragon118> Mission 2 and you get a nice suprise that wasn’t in the first game

[09/22/18, 10:45:43 PM] <topazshot88> She IS a Fire Emblem unit!
[09/22/18, 10:45:44 PM] <PhantomX1234> WOW
[09/22/18, 10:45:45 PM] <MythrilZenith> Literally Minerva
[09/22/18, 10:45:45 PM] <jezman612> Is this the 1st game of the night?
[09/22/18, 10:45:45 PM] <Slyguy46> Evening everyone!
[09/22/18, 10:45:46 PM] <DismalDimwit> is that the next operation we gotta go over? ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[09/22/18, 10:45:47 PM] <Just_some_dude12> Oh good, she's sassy...
[09/22/18, 10:45:48 PM] <ExplodingTittySyndrome> She's like four Fire Emblem characters mashed into one
[09/22/18, 10:45:49 PM] <darkharpinger> Hey its not-coredila
[09/22/18, 10:45:49 PM] <JosephTheElite> "I'm sorry, I was too busy crying over the flowers."

[09/22/18, 10:45:52 PM] <disgaea_demon_overlord> @Kuuribro Alright. I've only played Awakening though.
[09/22/18, 10:45:53 PM] <CeIebiSon_M> @xilehnoc Clifford the big red stab wound

[09/22/18, 10:45:57 PM] <firebird31> Welp, I guess not-Cordelia will be my favorite character
[09/22/18, 10:45:58 PM] <Dharc_the_Dark_CHARMER> You are NOT Cordelia.
[09/22/18, 10:45:58 PM] <Eprlide> HMPH
[09/22/18, 10:45:59 PM] <JokingMask> She looks deadon like Cordelia except in Personality
[09/22/18, 10:45:59 PM] <CardianJoker> She even has a FE unit name... except she has a last name.
[09/22/18, 10:45:59 PM] <domonater33> What a bitch
[09/22/18, 10:45:59 PM] <darkharpinger> also not minerva
[09/22/18, 10:46:00 PM] <bigo26shen> @Camille_skyloft !
[09/22/18, 10:46:01 PM] <linkwolf4> lytFilth
[09/22/18, 10:46:02 PM] <NoirCore> Minerva IS the name of a FE unit too @ProtonJon :P
[09/22/18, 10:46:03 PM] <Xinrick> that does indeed look like a fire emblem character. Get in her pants!
[09/22/18, 10:46:04 PM] <ccznen> Hey, it's Brave Lance fodder Kappa
[09/22/18, 10:46:04 PM] <agentemerlad> Cordelia taking up the name of another FE character
[09/22/18, 10:46:05 PM] <Natelikesmemes> She's missing the wing clips
[09/22/18, 10:46:05 PM] <SDHshadow> Tsundere much?
[09/22/18, 10:46:05 PM] <kaidoi94> Hello Alexis Tipton
[09/22/18, 10:46:06 PM] <Ikkarrow> she even has the name of a fire emblem unit
[09/22/18, 10:46:07 PM] <Kuuribro> @disgaea_demon_overlord alrigth scratch that. Awakening is *not* a good comparison
[09/22/18, 10:46:07 PM] <xilehnoc> @CeIebiSon_M Oh god they started that in September? I thought it was december
[09/22/18, 10:46:08 PM] <Kairamek> Sorry Lt. Headupherownass
[09/22/18, 10:46:09 PM] <taganplaysstuff> First Morag and now Cordelia. Man so many stolen characters
[09/22/18, 10:46:10 PM] <PhantomX1234> WELP
[09/22/18, 10:46:10 PM] <PitViper27> It's like Cordellia and Severa did a fusion dance.
[09/22/18, 10:46:11 PM] <TheAmazingMistaC> She looks kinda like the FE Minerva.
[09/22/18, 10:46:12 PM] <CityofCyn> protonGood
[09/22/18, 10:46:13 PM] <Just_some_dude12> @xilehnoc I KNEW IT!!!
[09/22/18, 10:46:15 PM] <Vanudude79> Wasn't Minerva a FE unit in Sacred Stones?
[09/22/18, 10:46:16 PM] <indignantdragon118> She bares a slight resemblance to Pyra, mostly becaseu of the big knockers
[09/22/18, 10:46:17 PM] <PhantomX1234> protonGood
[09/22/18, 10:46:18 PM] <JimmyJamGame> Road roller?
[09/22/18, 10:46:19 PM] <etrianrune> protonGood
[09/22/18, 10:46:19 PM] <Camille_skyloft> It's not-Cordielia with her daughter's personnality.
[09/22/18, 10:46:19 PM] <MythrilZenith> Wait a second her VA sounds like Lucina's VA
[09/22/18, 10:46:20 PM] <redtwo006> Minervykins :)
[09/22/18, 10:46:21 PM] <DetectiveLwegi> I wont sugar coat it We are fucked
[09/22/18, 10:46:21 PM] <ChillinChum> Welp, I wanted to not have any spoilers. But Jon is playing VC, gotta watch. <3
[09/22/18, 10:46:22 PM] <CeIebiSon_M> @xilehnoc no I mean the game itself is a year old
[09/22/18, 10:46:22 PM] <brewsky93> Cliche start? Check.
[09/22/18, 10:46:23 PM] <TSGJamesR> Okay, someone needs to give her a lesson in humility.
[09/22/18, 10:46:24 PM] <TheMattHatter_> So we're the French?
[09/22/18, 10:46:26 PM] <zman23485> I almost just filled the chat with zeros because my phone was resting on the 0 key on the numberpad glad I caught that
[09/22/18, 10:46:27 PM] <disgaea_demon_overlord> @Kuuribro The only one TBS game I've played was Mario and Rabbids.
[09/22/18, 10:46:27 PM] <AtticusYK> so it's NOT our territory. Good to know.
[09/22/18, 10:46:29 PM] <Kidd_Decibel> I'm waiting for Cheche to call out, "SNACK TIME MINERVA!"
[09/22/18, 10:46:32 PM] <SuperCaptureDevice> Shadow Dragon, actually.
[09/22/18, 10:46:35 PM] <SilverScizor753> Minerva is an FE unit, but she looks more like Cordelia
[09/22/18, 10:46:36 PM] <NoirCore> @Vanudude79 Shadow Dragon/Mystery
[09/22/18, 10:46:36 PM] <The_goddamn_gameman> !
[09/22/18, 10:46:36 PM] <holytardis0708> So the empires evil? Big suprise
[09/22/18, 10:46:38 PM] <xilehnoc> @CeIebiSon_M Ohhhh
[09/22/18, 10:46:38 PM] <GoldenEpsilon> !
[09/22/18, 10:46:40 PM] <Camille_skyloft> And so are the Flowers.
[09/22/18, 10:46:40 PM] <FloralSerenity> @vanudude79 Shadow Dragon had a main character named Minerva
[09/22/18, 10:46:41 PM] <Ikkarrow> @Vanudude79 Mystery of the emblem with Marth
[09/22/18, 10:46:41 PM] <dreamcourse_keeby> Minerva was in Fe 1 3 11 and 12
[09/22/18, 10:46:44 PM] <HowIsThisAThing> If this draws out much longer, we'll never be able to save our flowers!
[09/22/18, 10:46:45 PM] <sparkin65> she is the name of a Wyvarn in Awakening
[09/22/18, 10:46:48 PM] <sitharc> very bad Kappa
[09/22/18, 10:46:49 PM] <JosephTheElite> Tha's just Europe but with an a at the end!
[09/22/18, 10:46:49 PM] <Just_some_dude12> Y'know, not Europe, Kappa
[09/22/18, 10:46:49 PM] <TheAmazingMistaC> Minerva was FE1, FE3, and their remakes.
[09/22/18, 10:46:50 PM] <xilehnoc> @CeIebiSon_M yeah I'm still not okay after that
[09/22/18, 10:46:50 PM] <PhantomX1234> Das bad.
[09/22/18, 10:46:51 PM] <ccznen> The Empire would not replant the flowers.
[09/22/18, 10:46:53 PM] <McJohnson88> xfd
[09/22/18, 10:46:54 PM] <AmephEstMako> That's good!
[09/22/18, 10:46:54 PM] <Camille_skyloft> And thus, I would be ded.
[09/22/18, 10:46:55 PM] <taganplaysstuff> Man this is just Fire Emblem with modern machinery isnt it?
[09/22/18, 10:46:55 PM] <Hwer412> das bad

[09/22/18, 10:47:01 PM] <Ninji64> THAT'S RAD
[09/22/18, 10:47:02 PM] <brewsky93> But is it protonGood?
[09/22/18, 10:47:04 PM] <DropsOfMoonlight> That's juat Spanish for Eurpoe!
[09/22/18, 10:47:04 PM] <omegatheta225> Das bad!
[09/22/18, 10:47:04 PM] <Myohel0> The toppings contain potassium benzoate
[09/22/18, 10:47:04 PM] <Kidd_Decibel> I mean, she even has the same eyes as Cordy
[09/22/18, 10:47:04 PM] <Hwer412> protonGood
[09/22/18, 10:47:05 PM] <Jam_Cop> They got off their brass and did something.
[09/22/18, 10:47:05 PM] <xilehnoc> LUL
[09/22/18, 10:47:06 PM] <topazshot88> Ooh, that's bad.

[09/22/18, 10:47:07 PM] <BlackDinoThunderRanger> thats bad
[09/22/18, 10:47:08 PM] <SDHshadow> @ProtonJon after all communism is just a red herring
[09/22/18, 10:47:09 PM] <topazshot88> That's good.
[09/22/18, 10:47:10 PM] <Lasersniper> xD
[09/22/18, 10:47:10 PM] <DamonKatumaru> Simpsons, much?
[09/22/18, 10:47:10 PM] <CitifiedDruid> How plot convenient.
[09/22/18, 10:47:10 PM] <PhantomX1234> Yeah.....
[09/22/18, 10:47:10 PM] <PitViper27> That's bad.
[09/22/18, 10:47:11 PM] <Kuuribro> It's not Fire Emblem. It has similarities, but the gameplay is significantly different
[09/22/18, 10:47:11 PM] <topazshot88> That's bad.
[09/22/18, 10:47:12 PM] <Sephiroth1204> that's gonna be bad
[09/22/18, 10:47:12 PM] <TSGJamesR> That's not gonna work...
[09/22/18, 10:47:12 PM] <NoirCore> @sparkin65 Named after SD Minerva in development. :P
[09/22/18, 10:47:12 PM] <Just_some_dude12> COUNTERMEASURES! protonRaid protonRaid protonRaid
[09/22/18, 10:47:13 PM] <KinkyRay> The Frogurt is also cursed
[09/22/18, 10:47:13 PM] <JokingMask> LUL
[09/22/18, 10:47:13 PM] <etrianrune> THATS RAD
[09/22/18, 10:47:14 PM] <andoru90> Thats bad
[09/22/18, 10:47:14 PM] <topazshot88> That's good!
[09/22/18, 10:47:14 PM] <DetectiveLwegi> so we murder everyone?
[09/22/18, 10:47:15 PM] <Duskswolf> bad idea
[09/22/18, 10:47:16 PM] <myaringrisk95> Sounds too good to be true.
[09/22/18, 10:47:16 PM] <Vanudude79> Oh that's right! I haven't played Shadow Dragon in forever
[09/22/18, 10:47:17 PM] <CityofCyn> The worst idea
[09/22/18, 10:47:17 PM] <Kairamek> This early in the game? That's bad
[09/22/18, 10:47:17 PM] <amanda_f9> It comes with a free frogurt!
[09/22/18, 10:47:17 PM] <CDChow> They gonna die
[09/22/18, 10:47:17 PM] <topazshot88> ........
[09/22/18, 10:47:18 PM] <CounterpointClover> Yeah! Save Europa, please. :P Camille and I will be grateful. ;)
[09/22/18, 10:47:19 PM] <TSGJamesR> That's suicice...
[09/22/18, 10:47:20 PM] <Xero_J> That always goes SO well
[09/22/18, 10:47:20 PM] <topazshot88> Can I go now?
[09/22/18, 10:47:20 PM] <Bronyraikou888> @protonjon Fascism in a Sega game?
[09/22/18, 10:47:20 PM] <Meteorsmasher4> hi Hon what did I miss?
[09/22/18, 10:47:20 PM] <Xinrick> BAD IDEA
[09/22/18, 10:47:22 PM] <McJohnson88> "Put all our force into one strike." that's bad
[09/22/18, 10:47:22 PM] <AtticusYK> so, the crotch?
[09/22/18, 10:47:22 PM] <AzureIceDragon> So Shoot a Train at them?
[09/22/18, 10:47:23 PM] <Hwer412> the nuts
[09/22/18, 10:47:23 PM] <disgaea_demon_overlord> @Kuuribro Just like Disgaea.
[09/22/18, 10:47:24 PM] <myaringrisk95> IT'S A TRAP!
[09/22/18, 10:47:24 PM] <OrionX2> ALEXIS TIPTON!!!
[09/22/18, 10:47:25 PM] <Dharc_the_Dark_CHARMER> That didn't work for the IJN...
[09/22/18, 10:47:25 PM] <DarthFun> That's good, I like it
[09/22/18, 10:47:25 PM] <LaskoCatnip> One. Fell. Swoop.
[09/22/18, 10:47:25 PM] <kiran50> so this is in europe
[09/22/18, 10:47:26 PM] <Wandering_Spellsword> That's a bad plan...
[09/22/18, 10:47:26 PM] <CeIebiSon_M> @xilehnoc Siivagunner did a rip of one of their songs today, mashed it up with Happy Birthday
[09/22/18, 10:47:26 PM] <kiareall> bad plan
[09/22/18, 10:47:27 PM] <Ikkarrow> so who here like fire emblem apparently
[09/22/18, 10:47:29 PM] <Meteorsmasher4> him*
[09/22/18, 10:47:29 PM] <SuperCaptureDevice> Twitch does not like me tonight.
[09/22/18, 10:47:29 PM] <Uchel> What could possibly go wrong?
[09/22/18, 10:47:33 PM] <HowIsThisAThing> This seems like not the best plan.
[09/22/18, 10:47:34 PM] <akai_senshi> Literally everyone will die
[09/22/18, 10:47:34 PM] <ExplodingTittySyndrome> Wonder if this guy with the "generic NPC" design is gonna live or not
[09/22/18, 10:47:34 PM] <CityofCyn> BYE EUROPA
[09/22/18, 10:47:35 PM] <Foxgamer01> @ProtonJon Um, that smells like a trap.
[09/22/18, 10:47:37 PM] <MythrilZenith> Minerva's VA is totally Lucina's VA from FE:Warriors/Awakening
[09/22/18, 10:47:37 PM] <drakedraggin> This is gonna fail.
[09/22/18, 10:47:38 PM] <Camille_skyloft> @CounterpointClover Yeah ! Save us @ProtonJon ! Save the Europeans !
[09/22/18, 10:47:39 PM] <Xinrick> OH GOOD
[09/22/18, 10:47:40 PM] <sitharc> All of them Kappa
[09/22/18, 10:47:41 PM] <malSet> ...and if it fails?
[09/22/18, 10:47:41 PM] <Just_some_dude12> I could,
[09/22/18, 10:47:42 PM] <Natelikesmemes> Only ONE crucial enemy base?
[09/22/18, 10:47:43 PM] <drakedraggin> Miserably.
[09/22/18, 10:47:43 PM] <MarineVanguard> protonDeath

[09/22/18, 10:59:26 PM] <Myohel0> Oh really, references to VC1?
[09/22/18, 10:59:27 PM] <MarioKart2014> WHY DON"T THEY MOVE AND FIGHT INSTEAD OF COMPLAIN!!!!!!!
[09/22/18, 10:59:28 PM] <IcePhysics> Oh look, this army actually feels like telling their troops critical information, unlike a certain commander Purple Hair

[09/22/18, 11:11:29 PM] <redtwo006> The great thing about Jon's shooting is that you are perfectly safe so long as you stand right in front of the target.
[09/22/18, 11:11:29 PM] <Rocket_Mayhem> oh yeah this is an rts like X-com I fogot to mention
[09/22/18, 11:11:29 PM] <TheMattHatter_> You messed that building in the background up pretty badly though

[09/22/18, 11:11:44 PM] <Balthier7285> @ProtonJon Lancers are not know for their accuracy

[09/22/18, 11:11:47 PM] <ShadowZotai> did they get rid of the outer circle that tells the player the likely spot the projectile might go
[09/22/18, 11:11:47 PM] <indignantdragon118> This is why players of the first game forcused on making the tank more like a sniper

[09/22/18, 11:12:27 PM] <Balthier7285> @ProtonJon that was a potential, they activate randomly some are good and others are bad
[09/22/18, 11:12:27 PM] <issac232> Units have potentials, both positive and negative. Her negative took away ammo.

[09/22/18, 11:23:00 PM] <djwatchr> Bring in an Engineer, the extra ammo is SUPER useful

[09/22/18, 11:23:02 PM] <brewsky93> Better take those camps quick then.
[09/22/18, 11:23:02 PM] <Balthier7285> @ProtonJon no they just skipped their turn they did NOT call for more help

[09/22/18, 11:23:06 PM] <sitharc> watButt
[09/22/18, 11:23:07 PM] <SweetieAsh> They actually probably skipped their turn because they couldn't see a unit to hit.
[09/22/18, 11:23:08 PM] <GrumpingJimmy> No they did nothing
[09/22/18, 11:23:13 PM] <brewsky93> @Cloud3514 This is the Steam version.
[09/22/18, 11:23:14 PM] <ShinkuTear1> @ProtonJon enemies sometimes waste CP and end their turns early, especially early game
[09/22/18, 11:23:16 PM] <CitifiedDruid> Kai has consistently been super useful.
[09/22/18, 11:23:18 PM] <Wandering_Spellsword> What!?
[09/22/18, 11:23:20 PM] <andoru90> They just skipped their turn
[09/22/18, 11:23:28 PM] <xilehnoc> @schmarkstar I haven't played as Aqua yet so I can't give a proper stance but Ventus is my fav of the two I've played as for gameplay and Terra is better for story - he feels like the main character of the main characters, if that makes sense
[09/22/18, 11:23:29 PM] <JeffreyRinas> Heyo
[09/22/18, 11:23:29 PM] <davestar1230> Idea for the ultimate soldier: A guy in armor coated with sandbags for infinite cover

[09/22/18, 11:23:36 PM] <FusionFiction63> Ow. Quit it.
[09/22/18, 11:23:37 PM] <Jarr2003> That was a very anti-climactic shot

[09/22/18, 11:24:00 PM] <DeltaPhoxtrot> @GamerMoonie Because this game is stupid.
[09/22/18, 11:24:08 PM] <ExplodingTittySyndrome> Everyone in this game seems pretty cool with getting shot in the head
[09/22/18, 11:24:11 PM] <HiroProtagonest> @ProtonJon So I assume that in this series, communism is just a red herring?
[09/22/18, 11:24:11 PM] <16BitGamerCat> Send a rocket at a turret.
[09/22/18, 11:24:15 PM] <Pokegod11> headshot critical damage is negated when crouched behind cover

[09/22/18, 11:24:16 PM] <aliasmoon> maybe the mortar shot in the tank can clear those turrets
[09/22/18, 11:24:16 PM] <ChillinChum> @Sciesith Generally speaking, some characters are just crazy compentent, but most of everyone could be somewhat useful, it's more important to get accurate weapons, as even the best will struggle with accuracy without. And as far as I can tell, you cannot win the game with just one person, and even if you could, that'd be a serious self-imposed challenge, done by those who've beaten these games before.

[09/22/18, 11:25:41 PM] <schmarkstar> @xilehnoc I get what you are saying. And I also think that gameplay wise Ventus is my fav. I won't say anything but Aqua is the best character in terms of the story.

[09/22/18, 11:26:13 PM] <ChillinChum> @RayGallade Your mileage may vary, but 1 definitely, 2 has some debate, 3 yes, revolution is a different type of game altogether, and duel was an online only thing that doesn't exist now I think.
[09/22/18, 11:26:15 PM] <lordlundar> Wait, an insurmountable knee high wall? What is this, FF 11?

[09/22/18, 11:27:50 PM] <Vinaca> that shot you knew would miss... MISSED, i did NOT see that coming
[09/22/18, 11:27:55 PM] <Christho4539> looks a lot more complicated than the first one's first chapter
[09/22/18, 11:27:57 PM] <TheAnarchyKnight> ohhey i just played the demo for this
[09/22/18, 11:27:58 PM] <Twentydragon> Camp? It's just a flagpole. What is this, Super Mario Bros.?

[09/22/18, 11:28:07 PM] <gallenfier> Flag pole it like Mario
[09/22/18, 11:28:07 PM] <Myohel0> For a sec, I thought that was a restriction on the soldiers' heights LUL
[09/22/18, 11:28:07 PM] <GokaiOrange> We're still playing this?
[09/22/18, 11:28:09 PM] <HowIsThisAThing> You capture that flag, Raz.
[09/22/18, 11:28:16 PM] <schmarkstar> @xilehnoc :D :D :D Yeah her VA puts in a mixed performace. But she does have pretty good lines in the game. And her VA has gotten better with the KH3 trailers.
[09/22/18, 11:28:25 PM] <TheAnarchyKnight> freakin loved the valkyria chronicles series
[09/22/18, 11:28:26 PM] <xilehnoc> @schmarkstar glad to hear it
[09/22/18, 11:28:27 PM] <ZaBladeStrom> walk over enemy bodies to get extra goodies
[09/22/18, 11:28:36 PM] <TheBayxlr> Not only does this game get me to want to try out this series. It gets me to want to give tactics games another shot, period!
[09/22/18, 11:28:40 PM] <Zakeraz> I’ll wager the enemy has no such restrictions on their numbers.
[09/22/18, 11:28:44 PM] <Camille_skyloft> @CounterpointClover It's cool when you hear it, less cool when you're under it. :p
[09/22/18, 11:28:51 PM] <FusionFiction63> From what I've heard, VC3 is the best in the series. Which sucks since it's Japan only.
[09/22/18, 11:28:51 PM] <okam5594> Hi @ProtonJon how are you
[09/22/18, 11:28:56 PM] <Malonor> You could bank the cp ProtonJon
[09/22/18, 11:28:57 PM] <issac232> Blow up the fence with your tank, have tank capture bas
[09/22/18, 11:28:57 PM] <TheAnarchyKnight> should've had a scout
[09/22/18, 11:29:00 PM] <Balthier7285> you can always bank Cp

[09/22/18, 11:29:08 PM] <CounterpointClover> @Camille_skyloft Technically, it's MORE cool because you get soaked and it sucks. :P
[09/22/18, 11:29:11 PM] <DanTheEnigma> ...damn, now I wanna see Jon play XCOM again.
[09/22/18, 11:29:14 PM] <NotYourAverageCanadian> move lancer up

[09/22/18, 11:29:19 PM] <GoldenEpsilon> why didn't you shoot at them?
[09/22/18, 11:29:20 PM] <Camille_skyloft> @CounterpointClover Touché.
[09/22/18, 11:29:24 PM] <MarioKart2014> WHY CAN'T I MOVE????

[09/22/18, 11:29:31 PM] <AmephEstMako> Seems that the enemy is kind enough to let you know that they see you\
[09/22/18, 11:29:33 PM] <FloatingLasagnaCreature> hmmm, missed the beginning of the stream but this looks like xcom
[09/22/18, 11:29:42 PM] <Wandering_Spellsword> That turret is probably going to shred your foot troops. I wouldn't chance sending anything aside from the armor.
[09/22/18, 11:29:42 PM] <Balthier7285> again they just skipped thier turn
[09/22/18, 11:29:43 PM] <Camille_skyloft> YOU CAN'T HIDE FOREVER !
[09/22/18, 11:29:45 PM] <ChillinChum> @TheBayxlr YAY! naroYay You can find the first game on steam, and I'm fairly sure this is too. Otherwise, console versions.

[09/22/18, 11:29:58 PM] <DeltaPhoxtrot> And it'll be your last probably. Kappa.
[09/22/18, 11:30:01 PM] <TheMattHatter_> @ChillinChum I agree, having upgrades is more important and focus that. I also agree you can't win just with one characters, but it feels like every class has one character thats stronger than the rest that you need to do well.

[09/22/18, 11:31:34 PM] <Lasersniper> @ProtonJon According to DC Douglas' website he did the voice for Jester Mooney in this game. Which I am pretty sure is one of the scouts.

[09/22/18, 11:31:45 PM] <Cloud3514> There is a translation patch for Valkyria Chronicles 3. Because apparently Sega doesn't want your money for it.
[09/22/18, 11:31:46 PM] <Kidd_Decibel> https://store.steampowered.com/app/790820/Valkyria_Chronicles_4/ $60 USD, Sept 25th release day.

[09/22/18, 11:31:51 PM] <SmashToons> 1 is coming to Switch soon too.
[09/22/18, 11:31:52 PM] <kiran50> @ProtonJon will you ever do a full stream of this?

[09/22/18, 11:31:56 PM] <BadCzechPun> I am awful at strategy games but I'm still intrigued.

[09/22/18, 11:32:09 PM] <TheAnarchyKnight> Revolution was it's own game
[09/22/18, 11:32:09 PM] <DearMetallia> Would not recommend Revolution unless you just HAVE to have every Valkyria game
[09/22/18, 11:32:11 PM] <ChillinChum> Revolutions is definitely the black sheep, it's not really a tactics game from what I'm told.

It'll be ironic, and then his wife will leave him and go be with the man who invented the elevator, because everyone knows that elevators are much sexier than stairs, and oh my God, I'm not even close to being at the top yet, why are there so many stairs?!?

[09/23/18, 12:15:06 AM] <just_happi> oh...That's not what I expected for that term of power sliding all the time to be*
[09/23/18, 12:15:08 AM] <tidaltempest45> @NaotoPlays And it doesn't feel like it's improved.
[09/23/18, 12:15:08 AM] <PhantomX1234> Oh.
[09/23/18, 12:15:11 AM] <csaur24> That's really good.
[09/23/18, 12:15:13 AM] <SilverKazeNinja> That's good.
[09/23/18, 12:15:14 AM] <Leo_Haramen> @ProtonJon On that topic,what do you think of the PS Classic News?
[09/23/18, 12:15:14 AM] <CoryAtPC> That's a nice feature
[09/23/18, 12:15:15 AM] <Rocket_Mayhem> snaking essentially is drifting to one direction then imediately to the opisite then back coninously to gain alot of speed from drift boosts(the tire flares), this works best on DS and slightly slower Double dash
[09/23/18, 12:15:15 AM] <Myohel0> Oh man, that's smart
[09/23/18, 12:15:15 AM] <GamerMoonie> Cool
[09/23/18, 12:15:22 AM] <KyrashiDraconis> Good call...
[09/23/18, 12:15:22 AM] <PhantomX1234> But it's still P2P.
[09/23/18, 12:15:22 AM] <Floofledoo> That's actually really good
[09/23/18, 12:15:22 AM] <sapphire918> The higher Waluigi’s voice gets the lower Wario’s gets
[09/23/18, 12:15:24 AM] <AWMonopolyMan000> @DantheEnigma Interestingly the Japanese side has some Famicom Disk System titles.
[09/23/18, 12:15:28 AM] <just_happi> That one I thought it was called Drafting*
[09/23/18, 12:15:28 AM] <PhantomX1234> BLUE SHELL
[09/23/18, 12:15:32 AM] <BigDreGamer> SPINY SHELL!
[09/23/18, 12:15:32 AM] <NaotoPlays> at least when playstation went to paid online it improved\
[09/23/18, 12:15:34 AM] <schmarkstar> @PhoxPhorus A strageaty game and some eggs
[09/23/18, 12:15:34 AM] <CoryAtPC> Hopefully they can fix the whole burning issue
[09/23/18, 12:15:36 AM] <brewsky93> But there's no suspend feature, so you need to actually save before quitting out of the game.
[09/23/18, 12:15:36 AM] <BlackDinoThunderRanger> blue hell?
[09/23/18, 12:15:37 AM] <0ZenAki0> Wondering where that Blue Spiny Shell was
[09/23/18, 12:15:39 AM] <jojothejman> It's 100% real
[09/23/18, 12:15:40 AM] <MagusAndrus> @ProtonJon As someone not familiar with grand Mario Kart skills, what is Snaking and why is it so "Game breaking"?
[09/23/18, 12:15:42 AM] <JackTrevorXD> yeah
[09/23/18, 12:15:43 AM] <Maverickhunterx> protonFinish
[09/23/18, 12:15:45 AM] <UltaKi> Someone put granddad 7 on nes switch
[09/23/18, 12:15:47 AM] <PhoxPhorus> @schmarkstar Thanks
[09/23/18, 12:15:48 AM] <game4brains123> I mean, we've already got sprite rips from tons of Switch games.
[09/23/18, 12:15:48 AM] <Pocketchimera> oh boy combat amphibians
[09/23/18, 12:15:49 AM] <UltaKi> Didn't believe it
[09/23/18, 12:15:49 AM] <flamingbagelforchrist> The catch is if your sub is gone the save dats is gone too
[09/23/18, 12:15:49 AM] <thebrawler56> NESflix is pretty much note for note the same as the NES classic
[09/23/18, 12:15:49 AM] <PhantomX1234> protonFinish
[09/23/18, 12:15:51 AM] <Geo_Terra> The Switch emulator is a poor port of the NES Classic emulator
[09/23/18, 12:15:52 AM] <jojothejman> THere's literally just an emulatior in there and you put the rom files in
[09/23/18, 12:15:53 AM] <TheMightyenaManiac> We're calling it NESflix now? LUL BRILLIANT
[09/23/18, 12:15:54 AM] <Kyon2570> @UltaKi Nooooooo
[09/23/18, 12:15:56 AM] <Guindimere> we modded our SNES classic and added more games. It is awesome!
[09/23/18, 12:15:58 AM] <BigDreGamer> @0ZenAki0 If this were MKWii, jon would have been hit with 3 of them by now. :P

[09/23/18, 12:16:07 AM] <Smashmaster89> @MagusAndrus basically just drifting back and forth on straightaways to get more SPEED
[09/23/18, 12:16:10 AM] <Rocket_Mayhem> drifting gives a speed boost after blue ftire flares
[09/23/18, 12:16:11 AM] <MarioKart2014> This one....
[09/23/18, 12:16:11 AM] <just_happi> Snaking is power drifting all the time
[09/23/18, 12:16:12 AM] <CounterpointClover> I've always liked this track. :)
[09/23/18, 12:16:13 AM] <Floofledoo> This is really making me wanna play this game again
[09/23/18, 12:16:14 AM] <CeIebiSon_M> MY FAVORITE TRACK ON THIS GAME
[09/23/18, 12:16:15 AM] <0ZenAki0> @BigDreGamer I would have to agree
[09/23/18, 12:16:19 AM] <tidaltempest45> ROMS ARE BAD
[09/23/18, 12:16:19 AM] <drakedraggin> Oh, I love Sky Garden!
[09/23/18, 12:16:19 AM] <Shanewalker227> Is it just me, or did it look like Waluigi waved his arms like Kermit when he got hit by the blue shell?
[09/23/18, 12:16:19 AM] <lordlundar> @BigDreGamer yeah, they are cheap with that.
[09/23/18, 12:16:20 AM] <Serranade> this track is so nice
[09/23/18, 12:16:24 AM] <tidaltempest45> PUTS ROMS IN A EMULATOR
[09/23/18, 12:16:24 AM] <GamerMoonie> WEEGEE
[09/23/18, 12:16:25 AM] <just_happi> its broken because it allows for easy speed boosts
[09/23/18, 12:16:26 AM] <tidaltempest45> GENIUS
[09/23/18, 12:16:27 AM] <CoryAtPC> Since the ROMs in there are .nes files
[09/23/18, 12:16:28 AM] <9_Blades> Sky Garden has such good music Kreygasm
[09/23/18, 12:16:29 AM] <phanpyken986> I never got to play this course unfortunately
[09/23/18, 12:16:32 AM] <CounterpointClover> @CelebiSon_M High five! masaeYay
[09/23/18, 12:16:32 AM] <drakedraggin> GBA Mario kart was my first Mario kart.
[09/23/18, 12:16:32 AM] <brewsky93> They pretty much took the software from the NES Classic and made it compatible with Switch.
[09/23/18, 12:16:35 AM] <JackTrevorXD> And they wonder why they get shit about Emulaters
[09/23/18, 12:16:37 AM] <shadowmario55> I REMEMEBR SKY GARDEN

[09/23/18, 12:16:44 AM] <9_Blades> Its basically the same as the (S)NES classic editon
[09/23/18, 12:16:47 AM] <schmarkstar> Ikaruga is on sale right now.

[09/23/18, 12:16:51 AM] <Rocket_Mayhem> so drifting then moving left/right till the tire flares go blue let go gives a speed boost
[09/23/18, 12:16:52 AM] <drakedraggin> And I know the shortcuts on this track.
[09/23/18, 12:16:52 AM] <NaotoPlays> wait, This Explains Why They Attacked Rom Sites

[09/23/18, 12:17:22 AM] <Shanewalker227> It's Nintendo. Who knows what they're going to do, in general?
[09/23/18, 12:17:22 AM] <Wayward524> it's worrisome
[09/23/18, 12:17:23 AM] <Maverickhunterx> DD1 had both
[09/23/18, 12:17:29 AM] <Maverickhunterx> can confirm
[09/23/18, 12:17:29 AM] <damblade24> @ProtonJon Soooooooo Much Final Fantasy the Switch is Gettting
[09/23/18, 12:17:29 AM] <MrSkerpentine> BUT HOW WILL I BE ABLE TO PLAY ALL MY FAVORITE SIMPLE ASS GAMES FROM 30 YEARS AGO WITHOUT NINTENDO SWITCH
[09/23/18, 12:17:30 AM] <Guindimere> you can plug the SNES Classic into the computer and just add more games. It was so easy and there was lots of room :) thanks nintendo
[09/23/18, 12:17:30 AM] <ACFan120> Wait, they said what would be coming next to NES Online?
[09/23/18, 12:17:35 AM] <Pit_the_Angel> @ProtonJon For Splatoon 2 at least if you sub for the full year you get codes for some exclusive gear
[09/23/18, 12:17:36 AM] <NaotoPlays> @ProtonJon this emulator situation is clearly the reason they attacked rom sites
[09/23/18, 12:17:38 AM] <tidaltempest45> Hell why is fucking Yoshi in the collection and not Metroid.
[09/23/18, 12:17:48 AM] <PhantomX1234> ANOTHER BLUE SHELL?!
[09/23/18, 12:17:49 AM] <NaotoPlays> Metroid is being added in November
[09/23/18, 12:17:53 AM] <lugiaxd1> I think the last time a product didn't sell well and they decided to double down on it was the 3DS
[09/23/18, 12:17:53 AM] <Rocket_Mayhem> Snaking takes advantage of drift boost by making them happen faster dry bones is the best for snaking
[09/23/18, 12:17:56 AM] <CodenameHockhead> DOUBLE SPINY protonWhat
[09/23/18, 12:17:56 AM] <topazshot88> Snake.
[09/23/18, 12:17:57 AM] <tidaltempest45> Why isnt Metroid there by default
[09/23/18, 12:17:58 AM] <topazshot88> Snake?
[09/23/18, 12:17:59 AM] <Maverickhunterx> They probably did it because DD2 is on the MiniNES

[09/23/18, 12:18:05 AM] <BadCzechPun> Ohhh.
[09/23/18, 12:18:06 AM] <BadRoad> "Snaking" is building boost by drifting on a straightaway.
[09/23/18, 12:18:06 AM] <McJohnson88> Constantly mini-turboing, basically
[09/23/18, 12:18:09 AM] <schmarkstar> @NaotoPlays RIP Emu Paradise

[09/23/18, 12:18:15 AM] <lugiaxd1> also DS introduced Blue Shell Armageddon
[09/23/18, 12:18:15 AM] <Drakendite> It's like drifting in a straight line
[09/23/18, 12:18:17 AM] <Bronyraikou888> @protonjon @boodamedz @dantheenigma Is Nintendo ever planning on releasing GameCube games at some point? And by any means, I mean. Not just Nintendo Switch Online.

[09/23/18, 12:18:18 AM] <katarani> I think Tecmo Bowl is in there as a contract compromiose to get Ninja Gaiden in there

[09/23/18, 12:18:59 AM] <McJohnson88> They specifically changed the mini-turbo mechanic for MKWii because of snaking in DS
[09/23/18, 12:19:00 AM] <GammaEmerald67> Getting stars is really hard in this and Wii iirc
[09/23/18, 12:19:01 AM] <MistahBen> LUL I just realized Yoshi, Donkey Kong, and Waluigi are in the top three. It's basically The Runaway Guys only not!
[09/23/18, 12:19:02 AM] <Smashmaster89> This is the game where it's most broken I believe

[09/23/18, 12:19:13 AM] <just_happi> I don't understand how the speed boost works in double Dash honestly
[09/23/18, 12:19:18 AM] <brewsky93> Up until Wii, in order to get a mini turbo from drifting, you have to alternate left and right. It's not like modern Mario Karts where drifting a certain distance gives you the mini turbo.
[09/23/18, 12:19:19 AM] <CodenameHockhead> As someone who played a decent amount of Mario Kart DS and knew how to snake....I can't snake for the life of me in Double Dash. WTRuck

[09/23/18, 1:17:47 AM] <AlopexGames> clearly it was with the parasol
[09/23/18, 1:17:48 AM] <RumHamKirby> I do remember Jon murdering his teammates in the New Super Mario games quite a bit.
[09/23/18, 1:17:49 AM] <Redlinkkid> i remember playing a board game of this
[09/23/18, 1:17:49 AM] <Kairi700> I've only played Clue two or three times X3
[09/23/18, 1:17:49 AM] <FusionFiction63> I have not played Clue in a very long time.
[09/23/18, 1:17:50 AM] <phanpyken986> I played the board game not the steam version
[09/23/18, 1:17:55 AM] <HowIsThisAThing> I like how there's a sword in the weapons section.
[09/23/18, 1:17:56 AM] <Wandering_Spellsword> Thinking about it,it'd be very easy to guess the method,if you could actually see the body.
[09/23/18, 1:17:58 AM] <BlackDinoThunderRanger> IT WAS MEEE lol

[09/23/18, 1:18:42 AM] <DEB79ful> Wait, is it a lute, or a crossbow?
[09/23/18, 1:18:42 AM] <RumHamKirby> It was me. I murdered Bambi's mom.

[09/23/18, 1:18:43 AM] <adamdotpng> Lute = El Kabong raysFox

[09/23/18, 1:19:06 AM] <Wrennemun> bludgeon i guess? maybe? a lute seems a little flimsy for that
[09/23/18, 1:19:07 AM] <UltaKi> Btw players don't look at Jon's stream for his cards
[09/23/18, 1:19:10 AM] <Jonathan_Shepard> you can use cards you have to help narrow down other things in a suggestiong
[09/23/18, 1:19:12 AM] <pokemonfreak97> presumably the weapons and rooms have equivalents in different themes
[09/23/18, 1:19:18 AM] <Michael4TheWin> its good to understand the tiny marks
[09/23/18, 1:19:19 AM] <Polykin_SilverShadow> @protonjon can you move the bit boss meter please
[09/23/18, 1:19:24 AM] <JackTrevorXD> @Remolay It's because of the DLC. If you have a different tileset, the murder weapons change based on the theme
[09/23/18, 1:19:24 AM] <Soylent_Chef> Professor Plum did nothing wrong within the context of the movie.

[09/23/18, 1:19:50 AM] <SailorSylveonMoon> wait, has Jon killed somebody more than once?
[09/23/18, 1:19:50 AM] <ViciousViridian> People speedrun an old version of Clue by instantly guessing the answer and reseting until it’s correct.

[09/23/18, 1:20:23 AM] <garland41> @ProtonJon Is that Colonel Mustard just Sean Bean?
[09/23/18, 1:20:24 AM] <sanjian13> @ProtonJon The game watches for anyone with the tag "ProtonJon" and weights the killer to that player ;)

[09/23/18, 1:25:38 AM] <grebobly> @ProtonJon The Clue society is weird that if you admit to murder, you get no punishment
[09/23/18, 1:25:38 AM] <pizza1016> also the person who did the murder doesn't know they did the murder

[09/23/18, 1:26:06 AM] <GamerMoonie> @ProtonJon We can't see the bottom of your card because of the BitBoss
[09/23/18, 1:26:07 AM] <Escorian> this game looks so fun
[09/23/18, 1:26:14 AM] <chanceofspinies> Jon, please move the bit boss.
[09/23/18, 1:26:16 AM] <Redlinkkid> kinda odd

[09/23/18, 1:26:21 AM] <MarioKart2014> Can we just play Sorry?
[09/23/18, 1:26:30 AM] <UnhelpfulNPC> Its also weird that you have to PROVE you are guilty
[09/23/18, 1:26:32 AM] <DragonLord_Carter> I liked the SNES version, where instead of it going "person is arrested" "victory comment", it goes "Victory comment", "you're arrested", "parting comment"... I think.
[09/23/18, 1:26:36 AM] <thefa56> Man, a lot of people want to admit they're the murderer
[09/23/18, 1:26:38 AM] <GuyGasher> @ProtonJon can you move the bit boss?
[09/23/18, 1:26:41 AM] <Joveoak054> It was a lovely view FOR MURDER
[09/23/18, 1:26:42 AM] <KyrashiDraconis> @ProtonJon BitBoss is blocking the bottom... again.
[09/23/18, 1:26:45 AM] <Drakendite> @ProtonJon I mean, Mr Body is usually known as a terrible person who kind of deserved to die most of the time.
[09/23/18, 1:26:48 AM] <assassino_jake> "So where did the murder take place?" "I don't know maybe the room with the rotting body, but I could be wrong."
[09/23/18, 1:26:52 AM] <RumHamKirby> Mrs. Plumb? Didn't she play Jan Brady?
[09/23/18, 1:26:52 AM] <kmj10> So every stream?
[09/23/18, 1:26:53 AM] <HowIsThisAThing> xD
[09/23/18, 1:26:54 AM] <ViciousViridian> You get more punishment for assuming someone else as the murderer than murdering someone and telling everyone.
[09/23/18, 1:26:55 AM] <JackTrevorXD> Murder isn't a crime in the Clue-niverse. It's how they keep the population in check.

[09/23/18, 1:28:40 AM] ** TSGJamesR shakes his finger at the saltiness.
[09/23/18, 1:28:42 AM] <PurpleManfly> why does the poison look like it's just whacking people with the bottle.
[09/23/18, 1:28:43 AM] <brewsky93> @GuyGasher Not a turn limit, but you are trying to figure it out before everyone else, and when someone else says they're close, you want to rush.
[09/23/18, 1:28:47 AM] <Soylent_Chef> @ProtonJon That was a house rule of ours to not accuse yourself
[09/23/18, 1:28:47 AM] <Myohel0> I KNEW YOU WERE A BAD MAN

[09/23/18, 1:28:49 AM] <Inshone> @GuyGasher The only time limit is how long it takes for someone to find out the solution. So anywhere from one turn to about 10+ turns

[09/23/18, 1:28:51 AM] <Escorian> you know what my favorite start is? when you have 3 room cards

[09/23/18, 1:29:28 AM] <Zoroarkarceus123> @wrennemun and which game would be the base? one for each entry?
[09/23/18, 1:29:29 AM] <XenoDanganMonicals> @Leinim Yeah, it's in the Steam Workshop
[09/23/18, 1:29:33 AM] <Maverickhunterx> Wouldn't that be considered turning yourself in?
[09/23/18, 1:29:34 AM] <BigDreGamer> What about a house rule where you have to accuse yourself first? Kappa

[09/23/18, 1:34:08 AM] <caliatom> It's so weird to see Orchid and White playing together, since Orchid replaced White in the most recent versions of the board game.
[09/23/18, 1:34:14 AM] <Kidd_Decibel> @SweetLew19 and its crossplatform. So Moblie can play with steam and vice versa

[09/23/18, 1:38:06 AM] <HowIsThisAThing> Perform so badly that it kills them.

[09/23/18, 1:38:12 AM] <SilverKazeNinja> USE A LUTE STRING AS A GAROTTE WIRE
[09/23/18, 1:38:13 AM] <que1991> it was all emile
[09/23/18, 1:38:13 AM] <BubbaSWalter> I am willing to bet Jon did it. The Reason I believe it is Jon is Streamer Curse @ProtonJon
[09/23/18, 1:38:13 AM] <Q_Tip24> that or cut a string and garrote someone
[09/23/18, 1:38:14 AM] <Floofledoo> Blunt force trauma is very effective
[09/23/18, 1:38:14 AM] <GuyGasher> @ProtonJon What if it gets put back on the cookie?

[09/23/18, 1:38:19 AM] <felixderkatzenbaer> @ProtonJon take off the strings and strangle them
[09/23/18, 1:38:20 AM] <frozenfaux> You serenade them and while their guard is down you smash them
[09/23/18, 1:38:21 AM] <Joveoak054> @ozzyman314 either blunt force or with the chords
[09/23/18, 1:38:22 AM] <eggsofsoda> you fill the lute with bricks problem solved Kappa

[09/23/18, 1:38:25 AM] <Alan_M00ch> I basically said the same thing Jon said.
[09/23/18, 1:38:25 AM] <BardicNeko> as a bard i can confirm atleast 5 lute kills
[09/23/18, 1:38:28 AM] <ToaVaxxok> Ka-BONGGG!
[09/23/18, 1:38:29 AM] <MagusAndrus> @ProtonJon There is a weapon in MOnster Hunter called the Hunting Horn... That's how you cill people with a Lute
[09/23/18, 1:38:30 AM] <LordOfDarkness8296> That sounds like a terrible use of a bard's lute.
[09/23/18, 1:38:32 AM] <TSGJamesR> I have a feeling if WoW ever does a Bard class, they'll make it like ETC in Heroes of the Storm. Basically a heavy metal god. \m/
[09/23/18, 1:38:32 AM] <caliatom> I mean, strangling them with the strings maybe?
[09/23/18, 1:38:35 AM] <Myohel0> TIL

[09/23/18, 1:38:58 AM] <crunchyinmilk> LUTE-ON: apply directly to the forehead
[09/23/18, 1:39:00 AM] <67ghosted> I'm pretty sure you just blame them on breaking the lute and watch as the lute owner rips them to pieces
[09/23/18, 1:39:00 AM] <Alan_M00ch> And then it becomes a mercy kill.
[09/23/18, 1:39:01 AM] <AdmiralAardvark> there are rules? Kappa
[09/23/18, 1:39:03 AM] <Soylent_Chef> how often does the mod choice win anyhow?
[09/23/18, 1:39:03 AM] <ZTrain1990> By the way, I noticed the rule about editing Wikipedia pages? What's the story behind that one?
[09/23/18, 1:39:03 AM] <MrSkerpentine> Dan gonna pull a Jeff Jarrett/Elias with that lute
[09/23/18, 1:39:05 AM] <DeltaPhoxtrot> WHY IS CLUE 3/10 OF A GIGABYTE
[09/23/18, 1:39:05 AM] <Marshtomp1662> What if you just jam so hard they have to give up their life as payment?
[09/23/18, 1:39:10 AM] <ozzyman314> I just think killing someone with a Lute as a suggestion is hilarious. LUL
[09/23/18, 1:39:12 AM] <TempestDemonArashi> clue is good

[09/23/18, 1:39:33 AM] <kiran50> @KinkyRay no you're going the wrong way fill the lute with spikes and hurl it as hard as you can at soemeone
[09/23/18, 1:39:35 AM] <togeyosh> So does this mean...?
[09/23/18, 1:39:36 AM] <JackTrevorXD> I think we got a gun
[09/23/18, 1:39:36 AM] <Vinaca> @protonjon i'd be down for the rest of the stream being clue
[09/23/18, 1:39:36 AM] <XenoDanganMonicals> They could've picked their own cards

[09/23/18, 1:39:54 AM] <MarioKart2014> Like what does the check mean?
[09/23/18, 1:39:54 AM] <brewsky93> @togeyosh It means the person who suggested really wanted to narrow down one of the categories.
[09/23/18, 1:39:54 AM] <DigiPichu> Wish one of the dlcs was of the movie characters but that would be expensive...
