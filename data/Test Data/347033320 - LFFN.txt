N [12/9/18, 7:07:07 PM] <EX0greyfox> its not that bad but it shouldn't be in
N [12/9/18, 7:07:07 PM] <Seanroni> the more percent you take, let's say you're at 100 percent, the more knockback you inflict @808Brodie
N [12/9/18, 7:07:08 PM] <HazmireTV> ivysaur beats k rool tell ur friends
N [12/9/18, 7:07:09 PM] <sunderkeenin> rage is a mechanic that just makes marthritis worse for characters that can't kill and allows stupid comebacks when you're getting fucking destroyed
N [12/9/18, 7:07:12 PM] <Pelagius_Hipbone_> @tlpaidbysteve ohh okay thank yoy
N [12/9/18, 7:07:13 PM] <comprehense> rage is just a casual mechanic lffnW
N [12/9/18, 7:07:14 PM] <lazerdogz> DOES ANYONE KNOW IF THIS GAME IS BAD OR NOT

N [12/9/18, 7:07:20 PM] <BeedleBeedle> @Pelagius_Hipbone_ a lot slower and simpler than melee, so when melee players try to play it it feels slow and boring
N [12/9/18, 7:07:20 PM] <808Brodie> @Seanroni thanks dude!
N [12/9/18, 7:07:21 PM] <Nekrome_> At least this game is already better than Sm4sh
N [12/9/18, 7:07:21 PM] <SupposedlyFun> JustATestBro well people are mostly coming from melee in this stream, so they're going to complain. It's a pretty stupid mechanic.
N [12/9/18, 7:07:21 PM] <hiikiiko> exactly
N [12/9/18, 7:07:24 PM] <vege68> there shuold defs be a rage toggle

N [12/9/18, 7:07:27 PM] <mechobra> its fun
N [12/9/18, 7:07:29 PM] <Warrior_of_Bacon> if you have high percent you cant ca.p because then you woild even be further behind,rage is just something that was introduced into smash 4 because the games would go to long
N [12/9/18, 7:07:29 PM] <car_fax> steamroll mechanic
N [12/9/18, 7:07:31 PM] <BionicLettuce> whats his GSP
N [12/9/18, 7:07:32 PM] <sunderkeenin> it also makes leads stronger year
N [12/9/18, 7:07:32 PM] <leojolo2112> crouch canceling is better than rage for comebacks and heavys
N [12/9/18, 7:07:32 PM] <cowboymimi> no it counts if your down a stock too
N [12/9/18, 7:07:34 PM] <Seanroni> @808Brodie :D
N [12/9/18, 7:07:35 PM] <michiel_31> could you maybe play a match with chrom or incineroar, trying to understand them more
N [12/9/18, 7:07:38 PM] <Joe_Silly> rage is bullshit and makes heavy characters inherently better late game
N [12/9/18, 7:07:39 PM] <HTTRkaiser> its a snowball mechanic rather than a comeback mechanic
N [12/9/18, 7:07:40 PM] <1010100010> rage is made for trash players like every single game those days
N [12/9/18, 7:07:41 PM] <97Riman> if you are in favor of rage you have either never gone to a smash tournament or go 2 and out every week

N [12/9/18, 7:08:05 PM] <Moobot> Leffen is using a GameCube controller with c-stick tilt, tap jump off, and regular sensitivity. Other controllers and setups are viable. GCC or Pro Controller lag is a myth.

N [12/9/18, 7:08:49 PM] <sunderkeenin> @yinyang0427 wolf looked sick in brawl too. It's just that the entire game was meta knight. We're actually getting to see wolf be awesome now
N [12/9/18, 7:08:49 PM] <BeedleBeedle> @Pelagius_Hipbone_ definitely not. I think brawl was the lowest point in smash and i think most people agree. every game since then has been an improvement tho imo

N [12/9/18, 7:10:22 PM] <TheGravyTrainTTK> @Shibbywan every character has rage yes. In Smash 4 it led to a lot of really jank kill setups
N [12/9/18, 7:10:22 PM] <narrowacks> Rage is just ridiculously stupid, why would you punish a player for playing well
N [12/9/18, 7:10:24 PM] <Mr_CRlZ> Zero needs some Melee in his life

[12/9/18, 7:10:30 PM] <hoban> leffen is #2 melee , top 10 world in dbfz. id give his opinion more weight than others

[12/9/18, 7:10:34 PM] <riskybusinesstomcruise> yeah I think Smash 4 players are just approaching this game with a Smash 4 mindset and doesn't seem like that approach will work too well

[12/9/18, 7:10:54 PM] <jagobah> I kinda wish they did something more interesting with rage, like how Tekken does, you can give up your rage for a super powerful move
[12/9/18, 7:10:56 PM] <Technocrow> I probably value leffen's opinions on ultimate the most right now
[12/9/18, 7:10:58 PM] <Nekrome_> I find that for falco too, hard to finish sick combos when they just have bulk rage

[12/9/18, 7:11:02 PM] <optiMal8854> yes his down smash is op
[12/9/18, 7:11:02 PM] <Sicca> Smash Ultimate's meta is going to be boring because everyone's going to be playing Inklings
[12/9/18, 7:11:03 PM] <SeelosC> whats v trigger?
[12/9/18, 7:11:03 PM] <MileSSB> lffn vs zero?
[12/9/18, 7:11:05 PM] <drogaslite> @LFFN what are your opinions on Captain Falcon?
[12/9/18, 7:11:06 PM] <izzylawl> lffnW
[12/9/18, 7:11:07 PM] <Sicca> according to Zero
[12/9/18, 7:11:07 PM] <ambassadude> ZERO OMEGALUL
[12/9/18, 7:11:07 PM] <ssbmnemo> smash4 is ded but we still call sm4sh veterans smash4 players
[12/9/18, 7:11:08 PM] <BeedleBeedle> @Pelagius_Hipbone_ np man. these are just my opinions tho and some people definitely prefer 4 and Ultimate to melee
[12/9/18, 7:11:09 PM] <Joe_Silly> @lffn who is the most ape character
[12/9/18, 7:11:09 PM] <t00meh> zero is just hbox but popular
[12/9/18, 7:11:10 PM] <ssbrandom> d tilt is good
[12/9/18, 7:11:10 PM] <TheGravyTrainTTK> V trigger is from SFV
[12/9/18, 7:11:11 PM] <jackie_cdp> Leffen what do you recommend for jumping? X-Y or Trigger/Z ?
[12/9/18, 7:11:11 PM] <DarkN0oB> @TheRealMcTwisterson Its there to make it more fun to spectate, it looks cooler
[12/9/18, 7:11:12 PM] <KasparVe> if melee was a 10 and smash 4 a 1, what would you rate ultimate (I know its only after 3 days or so, but still)
[12/9/18, 7:11:12 PM] <dunkMATTic> zero is gonna make a diss track, better laugh in his face
[12/9/18, 7:11:14 PM] <Aramaeus> does this mean you don't have a good opinion of lucario? @LFFN

[12/9/18, 7:11:31 PM] <Shibbywan> @LFFN Sparking is a good mechanic you think?
[12/9/18, 7:11:32 PM] <remyshyster> @lffn what would you like to see in place of rage that gives comeback potential?
[12/9/18, 7:11:32 PM] <Fatality_T> !controller
[12/9/18, 7:11:32 PM] <Moobot> Leffen is using a GameCube controller with c-stick tilt, tap jump off, and regular sensitivity. Other controllers and setups are viable. GCC or Pro Controller lag is a myth.

[12/9/18, 7:11:40 PM] <projecteuler> smash 4 players think picking a top tier nets you free wins
[12/9/18, 7:11:41 PM] <cowboymimi> @LFFN if you up b yoshi with the falcons you dont get your jump back?
[12/9/18, 7:11:42 PM] <sooted> @LFFN Do you think you're a top player at this game yet
[12/9/18, 7:11:42 PM] <DylanAilD0n> @LFFN what about the raqe mechanic in tekken?
[12/9/18, 7:11:43 PM] <Hgee100> sparking is prob the best variation of the comeback mechanic so far
[12/9/18, 7:11:43 PM] <KasparVe> if melee was a 10 and smash 4 a 1, what would you rate ultimate (I know its only after 3 days or so, but still)

[12/9/18, 7:11:55 PM] <Mnchngrngs> you don't need a comeback mechanic, why would you need a mechanic that makes the worse player win?

[12/9/18, 7:12:22 PM] <projecteuler> @remyshyster eh, melee has actual less viable characters
[12/9/18, 7:12:23 PM] <headerz60> @therichessstman ok. just saw someone say it in chat and was curious
[12/9/18, 7:12:24 PM] <YaBoiobZ> does he still think falco is the best in the game?

[12/9/18, 7:12:51 PM] <Sicca> I don't understand the mentality of hive-mining players opinions as the only factual truth. Leffen never said Falco was definitively #1, but that he might have the tools be really good and is worth labbing.

[12/9/18, 7:19:48 PM] <amAmorak> rage is just jank, whenever i play a game casual or compettive, it feels more rewarding when I improve on my own, not when the game gives me that free boost, I'm ok with smash catering to casuals and competitive players, but not when you put jank shit like infinite buffer and rage in the game

[12/9/18, 7:30:07 PM] <kalbSchnitzler> they should give heavys more options instead of just buffing their grabs and smash-attacks, imo

[12/9/18, 7:30:23 PM] <idlYink> noob question what is a jab reset
[12/9/18, 7:30:23 PM] <Kuryoku> I don't see how people can find that funny every time, all the time.
[12/9/18, 7:30:23 PM] <Kitten_fur> !controller
[12/9/18, 7:30:24 PM] <Moobot> Leffen is using a GameCube controller with c-stick tilt, tap jump off, and regular sensitivity. Other controllers and setups are viable. GCC or Pro Controller lag is a myth.
[12/9/18, 7:30:25 PM] <mathwizard296> have you tried fox @LFFN

[12/9/18, 7:30:31 PM] <evthmos> isnt jab reseting not real in this game? it just puts them in a tech situation

[12/9/18, 7:30:34 PM] <Rilex_Zefire> I honestly have 0 fucking clue why they removed shield drops

[12/9/18, 7:31:18 PM] <varsitymodsquad> can you meteor cancel?
[12/9/18, 7:31:19 PM] <c_four> at least they made off stage a bit more interesting in this game
[12/9/18, 7:31:26 PM] <tm92trickroom> @idlYink if someone doesnt tech then you can hit them with a weak move (e.g. a jab) and it will keep them in the knocked-down state for extra time
[12/9/18, 7:31:28 PM] <Sundeas> lffnYikes
[12/9/18, 7:31:29 PM] <Fideedle> with the amount of recovery characters have in this game, two people should not be able to grab the ledge lmfao
[12/9/18, 7:31:29 PM] <kapete44> Yo how are the Ice climbers without wobbling and chain grabbing?
[12/9/18, 7:31:32 PM] <Chemlo> @kim_jow_illah it's a long sellout story
[12/9/18, 7:31:32 PM] <c_four> everyone cant just recover for free 100% of the time
[12/9/18, 7:31:35 PM] <ThanatosTV> @LFFN can we play online in coop with someone form another console ? (in friend list per example)
[12/9/18, 7:31:35 PM] <Sn0wman> If ledge-trumping were an option in this game Kreygasm
[12/9/18, 7:31:38 PM] <Warrior_of_Bacon> thank you leffn for giving me something to not be bored with at this slow depressing day at work 😂
[12/9/18, 7:31:39 PM] <HyperCoda> @idlYink someone misses a tech, and you can do a really hard punish on them by jabbing them repeatedly and hitting them really hard
[12/9/18, 7:31:39 PM] <Sicca> The use of states are strange to me
[12/9/18, 7:31:46 PM] <riskybusinesstomcruise> How would you balance heavys Leffen?
[12/9/18, 7:31:48 PM] <Guciaro> @kapete44 they have tons of desyncs but its hard to get them down consistently
[12/9/18, 7:31:49 PM] <xForcier> @LFFN The belmonts are top tier cancer
[12/9/18, 7:31:51 PM] <Dirtydrops> @kim_jow_illah highest donar tag... dude donated 70$ and 2 cents for it

[12/9/18, 7:35:27 PM] <dragonrage03> leffen still stands that falco is the best spacie?
[12/9/18, 7:35:29 PM] <SchwaRL> do you like wolf more than falco?
[12/9/18, 7:35:31 PM] <Sundeas> @lffn How good do u find this game in comparison to the other Smash games?
[12/9/18, 7:35:34 PM] <akarshyy> @Mrman4321 honestly is the same as brawl i think sadly
[12/9/18, 7:35:35 PM] <JamieCal> @Mrman4321 his recovery is so bleh

[12/9/18, 7:35:50 PM] <JamieCal> it sucks that Fox and Falco can do stuff after side b, but Wolf can't

[12/9/18, 7:35:51 PM] <swee__> project m wolf was sooo sick
[12/9/18, 7:35:53 PM] <Chemlo> @Sundeas he thinks it's the best smash game since melee
[12/9/18, 7:35:54 PM] <Mrman4321> I like wolf a lot in general but his up b makes me wanna main another character instead
[12/9/18, 7:35:54 PM] <sigma_smt> @Kylexyz003 fuck that character, i actually have brain cells. that character is so degen
[12/9/18, 7:35:55 PM] <minimu5e> Wolf ain't bad but he's sick nasty tho
[12/9/18, 7:35:59 PM] <monkeywrench501> his side b seems really satisfying to hit
[12/9/18, 7:36:00 PM] <Mrman4321> PM made wolf hype af tho
[12/9/18, 7:36:02 PM] <minimu5e> easily one of the most fun characters in this game

[12/9/18, 7:36:05 PM] <ScubaFingSteve> Wolf can only get a kill at like 140 at the edge with backthrow and like 120+ with raw bckair
[12/9/18, 7:36:05 PM] <Airling> I butchered that sentence
[12/9/18, 7:36:08 PM] <nahuelpv> it really be like that

[12/9/18, 7:36:14 PM] <Zamazardde> Wolf needs a kill throw tbh
[12/9/18, 7:36:16 PM] <ScubaFingSteve> I love playing wolf but he needs another kill option
[12/9/18, 7:36:16 PM] <xForcier> Wolf is kinda like G&W
[12/9/18, 7:36:18 PM] <suhhpp> this stance is distracting lok

[12/9/18, 7:40:08 PM] <SirGabite> @LFFN Yeah i feel you, as a wolf main killing has been a pain in the ass, the most reliable kill move he has from my own experience outside of his smashes is his uptilt and even then people live forever

[12/9/18, 7:42:22 PM] <BunZSSBM> can you shine oos?
[12/9/18, 7:42:25 PM] <火災の炎> @black_ninja_16 she's the best at edge guarding though so she can get really early kills
[12/9/18, 7:42:25 PM] <sona_melee> Ledge grabbing is too easy
[12/9/18, 7:42:27 PM] <Plazmafreezie> nutsack is distracting me so much

[12/9/18, 7:42:31 PM] <evthmos> Leffen is playing wolf cause of a SUB goal, he will switch characters eventually
[12/9/18, 7:42:32 PM] <slickeddy7> nutsac in background?
[12/9/18, 7:42:32 PM] <火災の炎> @sona_melee your name is melee you should know
[12/9/18, 7:42:39 PM] <Dkbjvalentine69> you can mash out of bowsers side b
[12/9/18, 7:42:43 PM] <Pesvul> Bowsers super armor is ridiculous :/
[12/9/18, 7:42:44 PM] <Kylexyz003> @kapete44 They have chain grabs and desyncs super high skill ceiling they have the potential to kill easily
[12/9/18, 7:42:44 PM] <Legend12x2> Real talk why the fuck is there a nut sack in the background????
[12/9/18, 7:42:48 PM] <TimeMuffinMD> maybe when people optimise killing with side-b, you can extend leads pretty well I guess
[12/9/18, 7:42:50 PM] <eon257> @bunzssbm LUL
[12/9/18, 7:42:50 PM] <TimeMuffinMD> I agree tho

[12/9/18, 7:45:11 PM] <akarshyy> lmfao what the fuck
[12/9/18, 7:45:14 PM] <MrKingFunk> Bowser is really really good btw
[12/9/18, 7:45:15 PM] <RyanSocks> his recovery is trash
[12/9/18, 7:45:19 PM] <WhaleMailer> can you do some cute fall uair combos
[12/9/18, 7:45:24 PM] <MrKingFunk> he's extremely buffed despite not having throw kill confirms anymore
[12/9/18, 7:45:29 PM] <MrKingFunk> his side-b is insane now

[12/9/18, 7:45:38 PM] <k00laid> These hitboxes are awful lol
[12/9/18, 7:45:38 PM] <MrKingFunk> his buttons are better
[12/9/18, 7:45:42 PM] <Kingjumby> Wolf will probably just have to rely on 2 frames.

[12/9/18, 7:45:52 PM] <swirz> Leffen I’ve been playing a lot of Ridley and I think he has some great Arials and great edge guarding with kill moves
[12/9/18, 7:45:52 PM] <Stupidtrader> Its okay guys backthrow kills bowser at around 200%
[12/9/18, 7:45:56 PM] <Opuc> has bowsers fire always done like a fuck ton of damage compared to melee lol i noticed that in ultimate
[12/9/18, 7:46:01 PM] <stewyian> his shine has invincibility on startup i think, it did in brawl and has knockback

[12/9/18, 7:46:08 PM] <火災の炎> is there 2 frame in this game?
[12/9/18, 7:46:09 PM] <thisisagoodusername> snap to ledge has 2 frames of vulnerability
[12/9/18, 7:46:10 PM] <Kylexyz003> There's a 2 frame window to hit people when they grab the ledge
[12/9/18, 7:46:11 PM] <赤い王子> Simons recovery is bad but his projectiles and range make up for it
[12/9/18, 7:46:13 PM] <BerserkerGatsu> ye it's pretty bad
[12/9/18, 7:46:14 PM] <Mnchngrngs> in smash 4 when you recovered (even sweet spot) you could get hit for 2 frames before grabbing the ledge
[12/9/18, 7:46:17 PM] <LKM_Dr3am> 2 frames before you sweetspot you can get hit out of every recovery from below
[12/9/18, 7:46:18 PM] <evthmos> it exists in this game
[12/9/18, 7:46:19 PM] <Einhanderz> please guys its not ariels neither arials
[12/9/18, 7:46:19 PM] <The_flog_gnaw> Okays there 1 frame
[12/9/18, 7:46:20 PM] <akarshyy> it is exactly what u think it is
[12/9/18, 7:46:26 PM] <robbace> @LFFN when you grab the ledge theres 2 frames when you can get hit
[12/9/18, 7:46:26 PM] <Nickedo> @LFFN Problems with "slow" characters in games is that because they are to slow to do things reactively, they have to guess which introduces a braindead RNG element, thoughts?
[12/9/18, 7:46:27 PM] <IntellygentGS> when you grab the ledge, you are vulnerable for 2 frames
[12/9/18, 7:46:27 PM] <The_flog_gnaw> & then there 2
[12/9/18, 7:46:27 PM] <LKM_Dr3am> from above it doesn't exist

[12/9/18, 7:46:34 PM] <luigi_man_879> I think it is in this game and its dumb. its not real edgeguarding if you 2 frame LUL
[12/9/18, 7:46:36 PM] <SirGabite> @LFFN Theres 2 frames without intangability when grabbing the ledge
[12/9/18, 7:46:36 PM] <Yaystuffy> I wonder if this is actually FantomenK, this guy makes music.
[12/9/18, 7:46:38 PM] <xp0seid0nx> what do u think of samus?
[12/9/18, 7:46:38 PM] <shinytautology> AERIAL is the only correct spelling
[12/9/18, 7:46:40 PM] <triforceblast> you hit some one when they grab the ledge during the 2 frames of non invinciblity during the start of the granb
[12/9/18, 7:46:45 PM] <MeleeCancel> Aireals
[12/9/18, 7:46:45 PM] <Kylexyz003> Yes
[12/9/18, 7:46:49 PM] <Yaystuffy> And he's from Sweden.
[12/9/18, 7:46:49 PM] <bronxbomber517> There are 2 frames where you aren’t invulnerable while grabbing the ledge
[12/9/18, 7:46:50 PM] <LKM_Dr3am> yeah
[12/9/18, 7:46:51 PM] <Leuse> Areals
[12/9/18, 7:46:52 PM] <Clankd> Who best character rn?
[12/9/18, 7:46:53 PM] <idlYink> You don't think heavies will be good in tournament play even with how strong they are in this?
[12/9/18, 7:46:56 PM] <Mnchngrngs> yeah, it's not at all how you should edge guard
[12/9/18, 7:46:57 PM] <TheTickleMafia> yo chat has leff talked much about incineroar? not sure i wanna invest a bunch of time into him, cant make a decision
[12/9/18, 7:46:58 PM] <robbace> ye
[12/9/18, 7:46:58 PM] <ssb_Lucas> wait 2 frame is still in this game?
[12/9/18, 7:47:00 PM] <bronxbomber517> So if you tune it right you can get a free punish
[12/9/18, 7:47:01 PM] <LifeMakesMeLOL> Yeah, when your characters start their ledgegrab animaiton there's 2 frames of vulnerability
[12/9/18, 7:47:01 PM] <LKM_Dr3am> i don't know if its the same with airdodge
[12/9/18, 7:47:02 PM] <KungFuKieran> its 2 frames leff
[12/9/18, 7:47:04 PM] <TwitchTrance> aerial best font Kappa
[12/9/18, 7:47:04 PM] <RitzKrakerz> is the 2 frame mechanic in ultimate too?
[12/9/18, 7:47:06 PM] <KungFuKieran> cmon
[12/9/18, 7:47:08 PM] <ToastRL> for example, when sheik vanishes to ledge u have to frames to hit her before she grabs ledge
[12/9/18, 7:47:12 PM] <triforceblast> yes its in this game
[12/9/18, 7:47:12 PM] <evthmos> @LFFN wolds down smash grabs 2 frames pretty easily, but 2 framing is ass regardless LUL
[12/9/18, 7:47:14 PM] <LKM_Dr3am> and you don't get your jump back lol

[12/9/18, 7:47:15 PM] <kapete44> Is 2 framing not a thing in melee?
[12/9/18, 7:47:17 PM] <Chemlo> haHAA i read your frame timing
[12/9/18, 7:47:18 PM] <sheepagator> i thoughtt it was teleport recoveries only?
[12/9/18, 7:47:18 PM] <krippeta> haHAA
[12/9/18, 7:47:19 PM] <MeleeCancel> Air eels
[12/9/18, 7:47:20 PM] <darkbladeoverlord99> it is a guessing game. smash 4 players would just randomlaly do down air on the ledge and get it 4 percent of the time
[12/9/18, 7:47:21 PM] <Kingjumby> Moves with tons of active frames are good at 2 framing.
[12/9/18, 7:47:21 PM] <0nefastgoat> haHAA btw
[12/9/18, 7:47:22 PM] <Flowtaro> i mean what is edgeguarding other than a guessing game
[12/9/18, 7:47:23 PM] <Iconicnovaaa> I want to play wolf so bad BibleThump

[12/9/18, 7:47:32 PM] <idlYink> @kapete44 no in melee you are invulnerable on ledge from frame 1
[12/9/18, 7:47:32 PM] <火災の炎> @kapete44 of course not, melee doesn't have sweet spots lol
[12/9/18, 7:47:32 PM] <Superhero1999> @kapete44 hahaha
[12/9/18, 7:47:33 PM] <Kingjumby> Probably down smash.

[12/9/18, 7:47:36 PM] <ToastRL> dsmash works
[12/9/18, 7:47:39 PM] <TimeMuffinMD> d-smash or f-tilt
[12/9/18, 7:47:40 PM] <SirGabite> dsmash
[12/9/18, 7:47:42 PM] <Flowtaro> it's you making an informed decision based on their options
[12/9/18, 7:47:46 PM] <maleblackfiora> isnt that what melle players want no invincibility on ledge at all?
[12/9/18, 7:47:46 PM] <Kuryoku> I'd assume you'd use whatever has the most active frames?
[12/9/18, 7:47:47 PM] <Pesvul> This stage is sooo cluttered :(
[12/9/18, 7:47:48 PM] <FOKSTR0T> l;
[12/9/18, 7:47:50 PM] <Flowtaro> it's just another option
[12/9/18, 7:47:51 PM] <noirfgc> its not about guessing game its just a timing issue, you set up the edge guard and then react to the timing with a move that 2frames
[12/9/18, 7:47:51 PM] <Einhanderz> you call it aerials or you call it oreos, that's the only fucking alternative right answer
[12/9/18, 7:47:52 PM] <ToastRL> its not reliable tho
[12/9/18, 7:47:57 PM] <Chemlo> @maleblackfiora not quite?
[12/9/18, 7:47:58 PM] <kolibolli> but you can hit before the 2 frame on some recoveries
[12/9/18, 7:48:00 PM] <Kingjumby> It's really good against recoveries with really telegraphed timings, like teleports.
[12/9/18, 7:48:00 PM] <kapete44> 2 framing still bullshit
[12/9/18, 7:48:01 PM] <The_flog_gnaw> does anybody think a mishima can make it in this
[12/9/18, 7:48:01 PM] <bronxbomber517> Marth can 2-frame with fsmash

[12/9/18, 7:48:21 PM] <idlYink> @maleblackfiora lol no in melee you can setup infinite invulnerability on ledge on a lot of characters, for instance look up shino stall for sheik or fox up b stall

[12/9/18, 7:48:46 PM] <Kingjumby> 2 framing is in the game.
[12/9/18, 7:48:47 PM] <AnActualCoop> two frame is definitely in the game
[12/9/18, 7:48:47 PM] <sunderkeenin> @kapete44 2framing and ledge trumping is far worse than melee ledges

[12/9/18, 7:49:45 PM] <kapete44> leffen should money match zero
[12/9/18, 7:49:46 PM] <Kingjumby> @lffn 2 framing is really good against recoveries with telegraphed timings, like teleports.
[12/9/18, 7:49:47 PM] <Nickedo> @ LFFN Problem with "slow" characters in games is that because they are to slow to do things reactively, they have to guess which introduces a braindead RNG element, thoughts?
[12/9/18, 7:49:49 PM] <xp0seid0nx> I hope olimar is not the best character

[12/9/18, 7:50:04 PM] <kapete44> Olimar is good again?
[12/9/18, 7:50:05 PM] <Technocrow> somehow despite a difference in skill the games still feel pretty close

[12/9/18, 7:53:24 PM] <sunderkeenin> you think Nintendo would keep features that were in Brawl and Smash 4 that were good and helpful in online? Why would they do that when they can match 4 1v1 players into a FFA?!??!?!

[12/9/18, 7:56:48 PM] <questionwny> I'm really liking k rool in this game, he's one of the only characters that really feel like they can move around

[12/9/18, 7:57:16 PM] <tm92trickroom> i actually think elite smash being character specific is an OK decision but in quick play you should get full autonomy (and in elite you should be able to pick other elite chars)
[12/9/18, 7:57:24 PM] <SpicyCurry1990> @Generalbrwni has there even been a big tournament yet? LUL
[12/9/18, 7:57:27 PM] <sel2230> Nintendo is such a shit company. It just relies on the nostalgia of manchilds to stay afloat.

[12/9/18, 8:03:21 PM] <hiikiiko> yea, hes annoying at times
[12/9/18, 8:03:21 PM] <bronxbomber517> Leffen is the best at at least 3 characters
[12/9/18, 8:03:23 PM] <tm92trickroom> imagine being kojima and getting through all sorts of legal royalties shit and your character is bad FeelsBadMan
[12/9/18, 8:03:24 PM] <luigi_man_879> snake is pretty cool and i hope he gets some good buffs
[12/9/18, 8:03:24 PM] <Moobot> Leffen will be streaming ultimate 10+ hours every day trying to become the best. Follow to see more or sub for these great emotes: lffnS lffnRage lffnYikes lffnWoah lffnTrainer lffnEZ lffnNom lffnSnack lffnThink lffnW lffnFox

[12/9/18, 8:03:32 PM] <sel2230> did anyone watch wizzy's video on wavedashing? Wavedashing might be viable for ice climbers
[12/9/18, 8:03:33 PM] <luigi_man_879> if whe winds up being bad
[12/9/18, 8:03:34 PM] <DenuveLive> so is the gamecube controller laggier compared to the other controllers?
[12/9/18, 8:03:35 PM] <luigi_man_879> *he

[12/9/18, 8:03:51 PM] <Kylexyz003> Yeah wavedashing looks viable for ice climbers
[12/9/18, 8:03:53 PM] <LovelyFarts> Snake is so cool though
[12/9/18, 8:03:55 PM] <Chemlo> @DenuveLive controller lag is a myth, tell your friends
[12/9/18, 8:03:56 PM] <1301space> how do people watch zeros stream he doesn't even talk
[12/9/18, 8:03:59 PM] <downyourz> so.. why is Leffen's name Robert in the game?
[12/9/18, 8:03:59 PM] <kbrgod> i have 850 gsp but no elite online. how the hell do you get it
[12/9/18, 8:04:02 PM] <sunderkeenin> @DatzMagik I'm afraid of patched if they legit actually use their shit tier online with whack rulesets for balance
[12/9/18, 8:04:03 PM] <kolibolli> I hate this stage

[12/9/18, 8:04:05 PM] <火災の炎> @00ptic they couldn't in smash 4 so I doubt it

[12/9/18, 8:04:07 PM] <TriforceExodiaCombo> snake is like one of the few characters you cant just spam braindead
[12/9/18, 8:04:15 PM] <hiikiiko> watch some japanese player make top 4 at genesis with snake though, calling it now
[12/9/18, 8:04:15 PM] <Einhanderz> @1301space lmao i think he talks too much tbh

[12/9/18, 8:04:29 PM] <SSBMcheddar> @lffn what controller are you using? are you just using the dock with a gc adapter? im just wondering how to get the least input lag
[12/9/18, 8:04:30 PM] <Darkness3827> Robert is the person playing for Leffen
[12/9/18, 8:04:32 PM] <Duckhuntdoge> The C4 strats

[12/9/18, 8:04:44 PM] <tm92trickroom> @kbrgod yeah 820 was cutoff this afternoon feelsweirdman
[12/9/18, 8:04:53 PM] <火災の炎> sdi exists but its basically non-existant
[12/9/18, 8:04:58 PM] <sunderkeenin> !controller
[12/9/18, 8:04:58 PM] <Moobot> Leffen is using a GameCube controller with c-stick tilt, tap jump off, and regular sensitivity. Other controllers and setups are viable. GCC or Pro Controller lag is a myth.
[12/9/18, 8:05:02 PM] <masonnugent> @LFFN was this a one time thing or does this happen often to wolf? https://clips.twitch.tv/FunnyInspiringKleeKappaPride

[12/9/18, 8:05:07 PM] <Guciaro> @LFFN wwould you go to Ultimate Summit
[12/9/18, 8:05:08 PM] <Juice_Nasty> Didn't smash 4 have online tourneys you could enter? why would they remove that?
[12/9/18, 8:05:09 PM] <expandkong2016> Hey are you able to show off Bayo? I cant get kills with her easily and its hurting bruh. Also you stil maining Android 21?

[12/9/18, 8:05:28 PM] <Duckhuntdoge> Leffen legally changed his name to Robert
[12/9/18, 8:05:32 PM] <FireCapp> he just isnt falco
[12/9/18, 8:05:33 PM] <morgisthegoat> imagine how good this game would be if it had just a couple more melee mechancis :)
[12/9/18, 8:05:33 PM] <DenuveLive> so is the gamecube controller laggier than the other controllers ?
[12/9/18, 8:05:35 PM] <Cyyru> why so much wolf? just curious lffnEZ
[12/9/18, 8:05:36 PM] <Dparksays> @LFFN favorite characters so far?
[12/9/18, 8:05:37 PM] <Wintd001> @Juice_Nasty I don't remember them being very good, plus they were added later as a patch
[12/9/18, 8:05:42 PM] <muscle_gaymer> snake is the hottest guy in gaming
[12/9/18, 8:05:50 PM] <AntoClassic> think wolf is the worst spacie? @LFFN
[12/9/18, 8:05:53 PM] <Chemlo> @DenuveLive no the controllers are pretty much equal
[12/9/18, 8:05:54 PM] <Jobbus_Erectus> any thoughts on falcon?
[12/9/18, 8:05:55 PM] <Sn0wman> @DenuveLive no, they're just all laggy lol
[12/9/18, 8:05:55 PM] <Dominator_x7> does anyone know if leffen uses the claw grip?
[12/9/18, 8:05:55 PM] <joshthegod78> he's just not falco
[12/9/18, 8:05:58 PM] <Technocrow> what's the purpose of tilts on c stick?

[12/9/18, 8:06:28 PM] <armtoast> how does SDI work in this game?
[12/9/18, 8:06:28 PM] <gasping_panda> @lffn what’s your take on incenaroar?
[12/9/18, 8:06:30 PM] <Duckhuntdoge> turn up brightness?
[12/9/18, 8:06:32 PM] <Chemlo> placebo
[12/9/18, 8:06:33 PM] <Caasinom> @emp_zurg what a genius
[12/9/18, 8:06:33 PM] <IntellygentGS> true to his game Kappa
[12/9/18, 8:06:35 PM] <autismo68> i think he uses claw when he upsmashes with fox in melee
[12/9/18, 8:06:36 PM] <LovelyFarts> That's part of his character Kappa
[12/9/18, 8:06:36 PM] <hiikiiko> OCTOCAMO IN SMASH PogChamp
[12/9/18, 8:06:38 PM] <arbitraryasian_q> It's by design, he's supposed to be stealthy Kappa
[12/9/18, 8:06:38 PM] <schizosid> for snake it's canon
[12/9/18, 8:06:39 PM] <billpika> i played fox and he felt good, but all the spacies have good bairs which helps for edgeguarding
[12/9/18, 8:06:41 PM] <RyanSocks> some of the backgrounds are bad
[12/9/18, 8:06:43 PM] <TopCrunch> The stages are extremely distracting
[12/9/18, 8:06:44 PM] <Fideedle> He's supposed to be stealthy so its OK
[12/9/18, 8:06:44 PM] <TriforceExodiaCombo> its hard to see
[12/9/18, 8:06:45 PM] <Tittyqueue> hard to see
[12/9/18, 8:06:47 PM] <RennocMc> its hard
[12/9/18, 8:06:47 PM] <kanda_panda> try turning brightness up
[12/9/18, 8:06:48 PM] <c_four> it's hard to see
[12/9/18, 8:06:48 PM] <Duckhuntdoge> Thats Snakes gimmick
[12/9/18, 8:06:48 PM] <IntellygentGS> he is hard to see
[12/9/18, 8:06:48 PM] <DesVoador> very hard to see
[12/9/18, 8:06:48 PM] <Mnchngrngs> it's not just you
[12/9/18, 8:06:49 PM] <lynchbread> It's hard
[12/9/18, 8:06:50 PM] <sunderkeenin> it's hard to see
[12/9/18, 8:06:50 PM] <Darkness3827> yeah I agree
[12/9/18, 8:06:51 PM] <火災の炎> ITS CANON LOL
[12/9/18, 8:06:52 PM] <Saettta> just you
[12/9/18, 8:06:52 PM] <AntoClassic> snake discord talked about using different colors depending on stages lol
[12/9/18, 8:06:54 PM] <Justice_chip> 4Head
[12/9/18, 8:06:55 PM] <Darkness3827> it's very hard to see

[12/9/18, 8:06:57 PM] <Breakfasty> Yeah he is hard to see
[12/9/18, 8:06:57 PM] <sleepwalk1221> The camo is working lmfao. But he is hard to see
[12/9/18, 8:06:57 PM] <OrangeMILF> it's his passive abili
[12/9/18, 8:06:58 PM] <dRageSSBM> way too dark
[12/9/18, 8:06:59 PM] <APPLES25> yea seems like the pretty stages make it harder to see the chars sometimes
[12/9/18, 8:07:00 PM] <footdiveu> it is snake
[12/9/18, 8:07:02 PM] <Sn0wman> @SSBMcheddar I thought so too but I saw that analysis chemlo posted and also I did some unscientific slomo cam testing and concluded they're practically the same too
[12/9/18, 8:07:02 PM] <lajach> thats funny
[12/9/18, 8:07:02 PM] <morgisthegoat> every background should just be black
[12/9/18, 8:07:02 PM] <bossy1213> he blends in too well
[12/9/18, 8:07:03 PM] <LovelyFarts> But yeah, it's even hard to see Wolf
[12/9/18, 8:07:04 PM] <c_four> backgrounds shouldnt be dark
[12/9/18, 8:07:04 PM] <billpika> snake 2 stealthy
[12/9/18, 8:07:05 PM] <evthmos> nah ive actually been complaining about this a lot, the characters tend to mesh into the background
[12/9/18, 8:07:07 PM] <BasedJam16> It’s hard to see
[12/9/18, 8:07:08 PM] <kolibolli> Best character to learn the basics with? @LFFN
[12/9/18, 8:07:08 PM] <火災の炎> he has a passive ability
[12/9/18, 8:07:09 PM] <sunderkeenin> can we just have the option for pastel backgrounds that allow high contrast with the characters?
[12/9/18, 8:07:10 PM] <CuriousFace> Yeah I hate that the tags disappear. Its gonna be so bad in teams
[12/9/18, 8:07:11 PM] <belette_88> Fox has potential imo, but requires practice. zd played him well yesterday at the Xanadu tourney
[12/9/18, 8:07:11 PM] <sunderkeenin> seriously
[12/9/18, 8:07:12 PM] <Duckhuntdoge> I think it is Snake his color scheme blends in
[12/9/18, 8:07:16 PM] <TehSteak> Does snake not have the Mine on downsmash?
[12/9/18, 8:07:18 PM] <otaunt> why r u robert
[12/9/18, 8:07:20 PM] <IrregularJinny> @LFFN could be manyu reasons I can see what you mean, I had issues on FoD in matchups with alot of white effects from moves
[12/9/18, 8:07:21 PM] <c_four> you cant see me?
[12/9/18, 8:07:23 PM] <ombiance> no tags reduce lag lol

[12/9/18, 8:20:01 PM] <Moobot> Leffen is using a GameCube controller with c-stick tilt, tap jump off, and regular sensitivity. Other controllers and setups are viable. GCC or Pro Controller lag is a myth.

[12/9/18, 8:22:54 PM] <Moobot> Leffen is using a GameCube controller with c-stick tilt, tap jump off, and regular sensitivity. Other controllers and setups are viable. GCC or Pro Controller lag is a myth.

[12/9/18, 8:33:09 PM] <TopCrunch> I haven't played much Smash since Brawl, but it seems like edge game is becoming less and less relevant with these new titles, with most characters having good recovery and less room between stage and wall...is this true?

[12/9/18, 8:33:33 PM] <salad1001> @SSBM_Winston Effectively, her damage is consistent regardless of where sword hits
[12/9/18, 8:33:34 PM] <Polycubism> @gokugokugokunaruto69 nah ultimate is just wack and decided to add it

[12/9/18, 8:56:54 PM] <bronxbomber517> Honestly for the amount that it shows up in chat, you should have a subgoal for a video on smush netcode. (what is peer to peer, why ethernet is necessary for good play, how smush is abyssmal etc.)
[12/9/18, 8:56:55 PM] <Darkness3827> @sadstyle tell him to buy an ethernet cord then
[12/9/18, 8:56:57 PM] <Mnchngrngs> fox trot is the dash dance of this game

[12/9/18, 8:58:09 PM] <bronxbomber517> the shoulder pad kinda looks like its a part of wolfs chin if you arent looking carefully which is kinda bad
[12/9/18, 8:58:10 PM] <GrassfedBEEF7> lucina is my main..shes the tits
[12/9/18, 8:58:10 PM] <Applicationking> So what made him pick wolf, doesn't really seem the greatest character

[12/9/18, 8:58:24 PM] <xfaraz> looks like low quality
[12/9/18, 8:58:27 PM] <Rahma_Noodles> without a clear smile, wolf would look pissed
[12/9/18, 8:58:28 PM] <Luxnite> even darker is best

[12/9/18, 8:58:38 PM] <metroboy> look great
[12/9/18, 8:58:38 PM] <Sazeny> @jmottotheking Seems like foxtrotting is just the same at least in terms the way it looks, like you cannot DD as fast as possible like you can in Melee, seems to depend on buffer or whatever
[12/9/18, 8:58:38 PM] <O_Circles> good
[12/9/18, 8:58:39 PM] <hiikiiko> thats best actually

[12/9/18, 9:01:51 PM] <Moobot> Leffen is using a GameCube controller with c-stick tilt, tap jump off, and regular sensitivity. Other controllers and setups are viable. GCC or Pro Controller lag is a myth.

[12/9/18, 9:06:37 PM] <N64Supreme> @lffn thoughts on wolf?
[12/9/18, 9:06:37 PM] <AdequateMeatshield> Is leffen still maining pokemon trainer? Is wolf a new secondary or something?

[12/9/18, 9:06:49 PM] <sunderkeenin> @squirrelleader that's bad design, not ledge trumping being good for the game
[12/9/18, 9:06:51 PM] <CoverHyphen> @LFFN do you like this? https://imgur.com/a/SFiL0Ye
[12/9/18, 9:06:55 PM] <Duckhuntdoge> But Melee has 20 characters, this game has 80
[12/9/18, 9:06:56 PM] <Chemlo> lots of low tiers have good recovery

[12/9/18, 9:07:12 PM] <wazzaho> wait there IS or ISNT in ledge trump in ultimate?
[12/9/18, 9:07:14 PM] <Kibbleis> Kirby would be way better Kappa
[12/9/18, 9:07:16 PM] <spawnPipe> Literally a bunch of new mechanics that people like in this game, are just reintroduced melee and 64 mechanics lmfao
[12/9/18, 9:07:17 PM] <ToastRL> but link would be so much better if his recoverywasnt shit
[12/9/18, 9:07:18 PM] <luigi_man_879> @spawnPipe i love k rool but i agree rofl his recovery is kinda silly with that propellor hitbox
[12/9/18, 9:07:19 PM] <Pelagius_Hipbone_> @darkness3827 is ledge jumping in the game now? Or nah?
[12/9/18, 9:07:19 PM] <Junkyxx> i just had a 12 hour ER shift someone eat my ass FeelsBadMan
[12/9/18, 9:07:21 PM] <kolibolli> To me it seems like ultimate has a good balance with gimping even though ledge trump exist @LFFN
[12/9/18, 9:07:22 PM] <squirrelleader> But melee was really unbalanced
[12/9/18, 9:07:27 PM] <uguubee> "just make certain niche aspects of it that i'm making arguments for being competitively more interesting more like melee"

[12/9/18, 9:07:32 PM] <sunderkeenin> @Duckhuntdoge less characters that are better and healthier for the game is better than more character that are badly designed. Quality over quantity.
[12/9/18, 9:07:32 PM] <OuterRaven> @LFFN which character you hate playing against the most?
[12/9/18, 9:07:33 PM] <Duckhuntdoge> @spawnPipe like?
[12/9/18, 9:07:35 PM] <armtoast> @lamealz it got a lot of things right mechancally , like it
[12/9/18, 9:07:38 PM] <armtoast> or not
[12/9/18, 9:07:38 PM] <darkbladeoverlord99> melee is incredibly well balanced among the top ten lol
[12/9/18, 9:07:39 PM] <OrangeMILF> i wanted to play ness in melee but fuck sheik
[12/9/18, 9:07:40 PM] <squirrelleader> The shitty recoveries in this game would put a lot of characters over the edge
[12/9/18, 9:07:49 PM] <Sean_Raider> @D1n__ I can't find the video you were talking about, who's it by?
[12/9/18, 9:07:51 PM] <globus99> lK rool is my favorite but he cannot be edgeguarded. Infinite vertical recovery and you can not guard from above b/c of helicopter hitbo
[12/9/18, 9:07:54 PM] <spawnPipe> @Duckhuntdoge Dash dancing, faster gameplay, airdodging to name a few
[12/9/18, 9:07:57 PM] <Duckhuntdoge> @sunderkeenin But this is a casual game first
[12/9/18, 9:07:58 PM] <lamealz> @armtoast idk i get bored of shiek v marth v falco v peach v puff after a while....
[12/9/18, 9:07:59 PM] <billybob1234567890> hey chat, which lan adapter is the best?
[12/9/18, 9:08:00 PM] <thepermitted> maybe he doesnt have any other option?

[12/9/18, 9:08:23 PM] <RappyFS> @thepermitted They have the option to not play online then
[12/9/18, 9:08:24 PM] <sunderkeenin> @Duckhuntdoge yes, and that's not an excuse for the game to have clear bad design choices. There are some things that are just bad for everybody.
[12/9/18, 9:08:25 PM] <WashMyShoes> bro who is robert
[12/9/18, 9:08:28 PM] <bronxbomber517> Leffen have you tested to see if Falco dair can edgeguard K Rool?
[12/9/18, 9:08:29 PM] <armtoast> @lamealz so returning to melee ledges would make both of those things true how...?
[12/9/18, 9:08:30 PM] <gregjoob> k rool can definetly be edgeguarded, ive been playing him all day and its happened plenty of times.
[12/9/18, 9:08:31 PM] <MoCapRobo> @creepled You need an usb to ethernet adapter
[12/9/18, 9:08:31 PM] <globus99> ya puff is good vs k rool
[12/9/18, 9:08:33 PM] <Jeak07> PeoplesChamp
[12/9/18, 9:08:34 PM] <clapathon> is wolf super strong or is duck hunt just super light

[12/9/18, 9:08:39 PM] <Sazeny> Melee is about the gameplay, not character variety per se, but the ways one can play the different characters

[12/9/18, 9:08:42 PM] <Wintd001> @HelionPrime4k online issues aside, i'm loving it
[12/9/18, 9:08:42 PM] <BROSOT> Isn't it assy even WITH ethernet?
[12/9/18, 9:08:42 PM] <bronxbomber517> If the move has that much priority the character must be pretty top tier haha
[12/9/18, 9:08:48 PM] <Meezor> imagine having a netcode so bad you can't even use wifi in 1v1 games
[12/9/18, 9:08:49 PM] <Duckhuntdoge> @sunderkeenin Ledge Trumping makes the game more acessible, its not an objectively bad mechanic
[12/9/18, 9:08:49 PM] <r4mos_c> tag is request by donation iirc
[12/9/18, 9:08:50 PM] <thepermitted> wait wait wait. so because im in a place without a perfect always consistent strong connection i shouldn't ever play online. lul ok

[12/9/18, 9:09:18 PM] <MemphisSmash> WiFi vs Ethernet isn’t the problem. It’s shit netcode.

[12/9/18, 9:09:20 PM] <creepled> sweet, I got one of those lying around, I just thought the switch didn't have the drivers
[12/9/18, 9:09:24 PM] <lovelivesif> nintendo was ALWAYS known for bad netcode, yall new to this?
[12/9/18, 9:09:24 PM] <creepled> thanks
[12/9/18, 9:09:26 PM] <Darkness3827> Ledge Trumping has it's positives, but it doesn't reward skilled play as much as Ledge Hogging does.
[12/9/18, 9:09:28 PM] <himynameisjohn> they couldve left ledge hogging in without making them degenerate like in brawl
[12/9/18, 9:09:31 PM] <sunderkeenin> @Duckhuntdoge it's a bad mechanic because it removes ledge counterplay options and favors stage play, harming characters with traditionally good edgeguarding.
[12/9/18, 9:09:31 PM] <Maxifus> @armtoast good shit

[12/9/18, 9:27:42 PM] <Crazymage1234> @sunderkeenin I loved Subspace, but it was really only fun to play through with friends once, 4 has more replayability but if you only play singleplayer modes then brawl has more
[12/9/18, 9:27:43 PM] <thesylar03> are u only playing wolf rn?

[12/9/18, 9:28:13 PM] <TehSteak> Drawn looks way less smug
[12/9/18, 9:28:13 PM] <kaboom_> i like the teak one
[12/9/18, 9:28:14 PM] <Sazeny> Brawl was very flawed, yet still was more interesting than Sm4sh

[12/9/18, 9:29:00 PM] <Innsjo> drawn is done because the best part of it is that wolf actually makes that face
[12/9/18, 9:29:01 PM] <PaDesai> Robert was a guy who donated 70 bucks
[12/9/18, 9:29:02 PM] <bronxbomber517> like you could probably edit the drawing to have the smile curve a little bit more

[12/9/18, 9:30:02 PM] <Chemlo> leffen's wolf is shnasty
[12/9/18, 9:30:03 PM] <midnight_lifter> !controller
[12/9/18, 9:30:03 PM] <Moobot> Leffen is using a GameCube controller with c-stick tilt, tap jump off, and regular sensitivity. Other controllers and setups are viable. GCC or Pro Controller lag is a myth.
[12/9/18, 9:30:05 PM] <PaDesai> @stride_lok oh i just assumed thats what it was
[12/9/18, 9:30:06 PM] <Sazeny> Sm4sh players probably feel like Ultimate is what Sm4sh ”should have been” or whatever
[12/9/18, 9:30:06 PM] <JmottoTheKing> @lffn do you find the Boost Grab tech that was found useful ?

[12/9/18, 9:30:46 PM] <Yaystuffy> You liked the v__virgin more.
[12/9/18, 9:30:49 PM] <KanielCinnamon> Who made the drawn one?
[12/9/18, 9:30:54 PM] <seresean> pok trn 1st
[12/9/18, 9:30:59 PM] <Sazeny> And like honestly if the game had come after Brawl I might have not picked up Melee 4Head cuz Sm4sh basically forced me to do so if wanted to continue playing competitive Smash and have fun
[12/9/18, 9:31:00 PM] <TehSteak> @hero676 play with whatever controller is comfy for YOU. Leffen can't tell you how your hands work
[12/9/18, 9:31:08 PM] <Danosaur> @sazeny especially in terms of single player. All 4 had was smash tour, which was garbage
[12/9/18, 9:31:11 PM] <JadedFlaco> is wolfs combo thro up?
