[12/11/18, 12:45:50 AM] <LiquidMathew> THEY MENTION IT LATER IN THE GAME
[12/11/18, 12:45:52 AM] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva his REAL KID is blonde
[12/11/18, 12:45:53 AM] <HannibalBeerus> BIG FORGET
[12/11/18, 12:45:53 AM] <OwlLightningMage> HE WASN'T ABUSING REAL PEOPLE
[12/11/18, 12:45:53 AM] <energywarning> it was like 2 months ago
[12/11/18, 12:45:54 AM] <Virokwet> i thought alice was a playmate for the sick kid
[12/11/18, 12:45:54 AM] <krawtch> i love how the chemical composition of red ice is literally just cocaine
[12/11/18, 12:45:56 AM] <Kataguro> It's in Alice's box of memories for some fucking reason
[12/11/18, 12:45:56 AM] <joylent_blue> HE RANTS ABOUT HIS EX WIFE AT THE DINNER TABLE
[12/11/18, 12:45:56 AM] <circular7> you forgot
[12/11/18, 12:45:57 AM] <deviljhojho94> SHE IS LIKE KARA
[12/11/18, 12:45:57 AM] <leadenstrides> She saw it a while ago to be fair
[12/11/18, 12:45:58 AM] <deviljhojho94> SHE FORGOT
[12/11/18, 12:45:58 AM] <Valison> 2
[12/11/18, 12:45:58 AM] <Sp3ctre48> Cause your memory is bad
[12/11/18, 12:45:58 AM] <theobble> YOU KNEW
[12/11/18, 12:45:58 AM] <mercado94> you dumb
[12/11/18, 12:45:59 AM] <AncelDeLambert> @PeachSaliva Pat, you're doing the big spoils
[12/11/18, 12:46:00 AM] <Skeletorexplains> and then 2B twerks on their corpses
[12/11/18, 12:46:01 AM] <Walopoh> It's mentioned in dialogue
[12/11/18, 12:46:02 AM] <emoonimoo> Because the photo was when the child was a toddler
[12/11/18, 12:46:02 AM] <OwlLightningMage> HE WAS BEATING HIS STRESS BALLS
[12/11/18, 12:46:02 AM] <booglesnurf> THATS RIGHT WOOLIE
[12/11/18, 12:46:03 AM] <badchoice5> PAIGE IS IN NO CONDITION FOR THIS MUCH CAGE
[12/11/18, 12:46:05 AM] <AXL808> Paige had her own mental block like Kara
[12/11/18, 12:46:05 AM] <Kataguro> Memories of a family that isn't hers
[12/11/18, 12:46:05 AM] <leadenstrides> It was not clear
[12/11/18, 12:46:06 AM] <cTAKU> BAIT AND SWITCH
[12/11/18, 12:46:06 AM] <Alpha820> You didn't notice it, BUT YOUR BRAIN DID.
[12/11/18, 12:46:08 AM] <OwlLightningMage> HE DID NOTHING WRONG
[12/11/18, 12:46:08 AM] <ExpendableComicRelief> cuz a lot of white kids are born with blonde hair but grow up to have brown
[12/11/18, 12:46:09 AM] <circular7> you took too long and forgot
[12/11/18, 12:46:09 AM] <PDS6400> FRUSTRATION IS GETTING BIGGER
[12/11/18, 12:46:11 AM] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva There were drawings of a blonde kid with todd and his wife and then drawings of Alice with brown hair
[12/11/18, 12:46:12 AM] <krawtch> BLOODY LIES
[12/11/18, 12:46:13 AM] <lightsinx98> Todd was just using his property the way he wanted to
[12/11/18, 12:46:15 AM] <TheMilhouseExperience> Too bad Paige killed Todd for NOTHING.
[12/11/18, 12:46:15 AM] <SlightlySychotic> That was a red ring.
[12/11/18, 12:46:16 AM] <Dr_mr_wang> RED BLOOD
[12/11/18, 12:46:18 AM] <Gruhunchously> Lies
[12/11/18, 12:46:19 AM] <rdark_ksu> big blood lie
[12/11/18, 12:46:19 AM] <deviljhojho94> BIG RETCON
[12/11/18, 12:46:20 AM] <HorseChange> It's such dumb thing, you ignore it, and anything else just seems like there just may not be enough detail.
[12/11/18, 12:46:21 AM] <mercado94> Thats red oil
[12/11/18, 12:46:21 AM] <SuichiTanaka> How did Alice have HOMEWORK?
[12/11/18, 12:46:22 AM] <sackerkappa> You know. You just don't want to see it.
[12/11/18, 12:46:23 AM] <AstroFalcon09> cage howard
[12/11/18, 12:46:23 AM] <gyrogogozeppeli> FOR FUCKS SAKE
[12/11/18, 12:46:23 AM] <AncelDeLambert> LYING FUCKING PICTURE
[12/11/18, 12:46:26 AM] <reonome> you can deactivate it
[12/11/18, 12:46:26 AM] <leadenstrides> That was also a while ago
[12/11/18, 12:46:27 AM] <averagehero1> Todd and Griffin did nothing wrong and are the heros of justice
[12/11/18, 12:46:28 AM] <SSaryn> A BIG FAT FUCKING LIE BY A FRENCH FUCK WHO LIKES THIRD ACT TWISTS TOO FUCKING MUCH
[12/11/18, 12:46:29 AM] <person181> kids can have them taken off
[12/11/18, 12:46:29 AM] <Maki_risu> LIES
[12/11/18, 12:46:29 AM] <badchoice5> IT COMES OFF SO EASY ITS LIKE A STICKEr
[12/11/18, 12:46:29 AM] <omen_setter> The Cage'd egg has hatched
[12/11/18, 12:46:32 AM] <JDebss> it's literally a sticker
[12/11/18, 12:46:34 AM] <deviljhojho94> Christ
[12/11/18, 12:46:34 AM] <gyrogogozeppeli> I HATE THIS VIDEOGAME
[12/11/18, 12:46:36 AM] <LiquidMathew> Todd removed it for the illiusion
[12/11/18, 12:46:36 AM] <Kataguro> But they don't bleed if you take it off, so that's nonsense
[12/11/18, 12:46:37 AM] <DrMoose7> the sticker fell off
[12/11/18, 12:46:38 AM] <cherubsanonymous> So he could ABUSE HIS ROBOT CHILD
[12/11/18, 12:46:38 AM] <Skeletorexplains> ROBOT SCHOOL
[12/11/18, 12:46:38 AM] <BioApple> Alice always has the blue thing I thought, Kara just ignored it because MOMMY,EXE
[12/11/18, 12:46:38 AM] <themagic_conch> IT WAS RIGHT THERE IN THE LAST SCENE
[12/11/18, 12:46:39 AM] <ExpendableComicRelief> @PeachSaliva They can turn it off.
[12/11/18, 12:46:39 AM] <Dragon_Batman> the weird thing is Alice drew a picture red blood. the blood came from the forehead where the led thing was
[12/11/18, 12:46:40 AM] <Keyd00d> ROBOT HOMEWORK
[12/11/18, 12:46:40 AM] <Gruhunchously> This is so bad
[12/11/18, 12:46:40 AM] <Graxe_> Kid robots can have them removed.
[12/11/18, 12:46:41 AM] <deviljhojho94> WAIT, YEAH
[12/11/18, 12:46:42 AM] <shozent> BUT WHY DOES IT COME BACK?
[12/11/18, 12:46:43 AM] <Bouldus> she drew a picture of him removing the led thing
[12/11/18, 12:46:43 AM] <Sp3ctre48> She had fake homework
[12/11/18, 12:46:43 AM] <spire6> "Don't trust his lies" on the back of David Cage's photo
[12/11/18, 12:46:43 AM] <deviljhojho94> WHAT THE FUCK
[12/11/18, 12:46:44 AM] <OwlLightningMage> SHE HAD HOMEWORK
[12/11/18, 12:46:45 AM] <booglesnurf> thanks I hate it
[12/11/18, 12:46:45 AM] <Endocrom> He's still abusing a thing that represents a child, it's like psychos and torturing animals
[12/11/18, 12:46:47 AM] <ExpendableComicRelief> The kid robots can turn their LEDs off.
[12/11/18, 12:46:49 AM] <Nova712> she still has the blue icon...
[12/11/18, 12:46:51 AM] <krawtch> watch me eat this spaghet, dollies.
[12/11/18, 12:46:52 AM] <3InchMensch> IT WAS REMOVED TO MAKE HER MORE LIKE A R E A L G I R L
[12/11/18, 12:46:52 AM] <Dr_mr_wang> HOMEWORK
[12/11/18, 12:46:53 AM] <MechaBaphomet> @PeachSaliva The LEDS are optional on the kid androids
[12/11/18, 12:46:53 AM] <JenovasPuppet> Running Homework Program
[12/11/18, 12:46:54 AM] <The_Esquana> he printed out problems from coolmathdotcom
[12/11/18, 12:46:54 AM] <GarbageQueenEllie> THE BITCH DON'T EVEN EAT
[12/11/18, 12:46:55 AM] <LiquidMathew> THEY CAN EAT
[12/11/18, 12:46:55 AM] <Mirrorcatch> this director is recognized by tedtalks by the way
[12/11/18, 12:46:57 AM] <SSaryn> They eat Spaget
[12/11/18, 12:46:58 AM] <Kataguro> It's like one of those hair-eating dolls
[12/11/18, 12:46:59 AM] <averagehero1> Robo homework am I right
[12/11/18, 12:46:59 AM] <cvp5127> todd did nothing wrong
[12/11/18, 12:47:00 AM] <Nova712> they can disable the blue icon off
[12/11/18, 12:47:01 AM] <rdark_ksu> literally wasted food. literally
[12/11/18, 12:47:03 AM] <alrobot2014> FEED HER MACKREL
[12/11/18, 12:47:03 AM] <omen_setter> this was really well thought out
[12/11/18, 12:47:04 AM] <Jontman42> He just eats both plates, that's why he's the fat evil
[12/11/18, 12:47:04 AM] <reonome> yeah they can turn it off
[12/11/18, 12:47:04 AM] <gyrogogozeppeli> YOURE WASTING SPHAGETTI FOR A ROBOT
[12/11/18, 12:47:05 AM] <Sphincter_Spelunker> I thought it was there the whole time and Kara never saw it. Out of denial
[12/11/18, 12:47:06 AM] <Kataguro> What?
[12/11/18, 12:47:06 AM] <Skeletorexplains> Spaghetti is the national food of all robots.
[12/11/18, 12:47:06 AM] <doofmaster> A good plot twist ADDS meaning to everything prior
[12/11/18, 12:47:06 AM] <Worldbrand> That's actually even dumber
[12/11/18, 12:47:07 AM] <OwlLightningMage> SHE WAS LYING THE WHOLE TIME
[12/11/18, 12:47:08 AM] <prime_name> YOU CAN TURN IT OFF?!
[12/11/18, 12:47:09 AM] <Dr_mr_wang> BULLSHIT
[12/11/18, 12:47:09 AM] <missingangle> No?
[12/11/18, 12:47:10 AM] <AlasterAngelo> OF THE ROBOTS JUST WORK - Todd
[12/11/18, 12:47:12 AM] <OwlLightningMage> IT'S SO STUPID
[12/11/18, 12:47:12 AM] <badchoice5> BECOME AS A GOD PAIGE
[12/11/18, 12:47:12 AM] <circular7> he was literally playing with his "dolls"
[12/11/18, 12:47:14 AM] <JDebss> Free Todd now!
[12/11/18, 12:47:14 AM] <Hadley> Wtf they can turn it off?
[12/11/18, 12:47:14 AM] <OceanGovernor> LUL he ate both plates
[12/11/18, 12:47:15 AM] <mercado94> BULLSHIT
[12/11/18, 12:47:15 AM] <Elexius> Because its a David Cage game, and every Cage game needs a FUCK YOU plot twist.
[12/11/18, 12:47:16 AM] <Kataguro> I'm pretty sure that's not true
[12/11/18, 12:47:17 AM] <Dutchpotato> that's wrong
[12/11/18, 12:47:18 AM] <Zalthia> You know what would fix this? If Alice TOLD Kara she was an Android in this scene, instead of her finding out.
[12/11/18, 12:47:18 AM] <averagehero1> HE EATS HER FOOD CAUSE HES FAT
[12/11/18, 12:47:18 AM] <VanLynx> HE'S POOR WHY MAKE MORE MEALS THAN NECESSARY
[12/11/18, 12:47:18 AM] <lethallunacyx> Todd is a standup individual, just minding his own business doing his drugs and beating his machines
[12/11/18, 12:47:19 AM] <AncelDeLambert> but then why the picture showing a head wound where the LED is?
[12/11/18, 12:47:19 AM] <smargh1015> BOXED LUNCHES BIG BRO
[12/11/18, 12:47:20 AM] <ExpendableComicRelief> Yeah you can, it mentions it in a magazine
[12/11/18, 12:47:21 AM] <MrDonTacos_> 10/10 WRITING LUL
[12/11/18, 12:47:21 AM] <NWR_James> BULLSHIT! THE LED IS A SECURITY FEATURE
[12/11/18, 12:47:22 AM] <Keyd00d> "pretty good"
[12/11/18, 12:47:22 AM] <Dragon_Batman> no I'm pretty shure Todd ripped it off
[12/11/18, 12:47:23 AM] <Skeletorexplains> THE BABY
[12/11/18, 12:47:24 AM] <Brovdig> Did paige gun down todd?
[12/11/18, 12:47:24 AM] <Dr_mr_wang> YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO REMOVE IT?
[12/11/18, 12:47:25 AM] <TheZombiepope> Maybe she was just a therapy tool for Todd to get over his abusive behavior
[12/11/18, 12:47:26 AM] <HorseChange> WOULD IT HAVE BEEN BETTER IF: Kara knew the entire time. Am I too hopeful?
[12/11/18, 12:47:26 AM] <st_jimmy456> it just cuts it out
[12/11/18, 12:47:28 AM] <Walopoh> The childhood drawing was the led getting ripped off but she drew the blood red instead of blue
[12/11/18, 12:47:28 AM] <CoalSavoie> No, there's a picture of Alice with her head bleeding is of the LED being removed
[12/11/18, 12:47:29 AM] <deviljhojho94> YOU CANT EVER ESCAPE THE CAGE
[12/11/18, 12:47:29 AM] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva Kara and Marcus just tore off their LEDs. Todd probably took hers off to look more like a hooman
[12/11/18, 12:47:30 AM] <Virokwet> no they cant, why else would they be ripping it off thier heands?
[12/11/18, 12:47:31 AM] <Freelance7> It makes it less interesting
[12/11/18, 12:47:33 AM] <TheMilhouseExperience> PAIGE is in a RAGE with the CAGE!
[12/11/18, 12:47:33 AM] <deviljhojho94> YOU WERE ALWAYS INSIDE THE CAGE
[12/11/18, 12:47:34 AM] <AXL808> she felt no love at all...
[12/11/18, 12:47:35 AM] <moranprime> Ending S[P]aghetti
[12/11/18, 12:47:35 AM] <Keyd00d> The game's pretty good, only 1/3 of it is tolerable
[12/11/18, 12:47:35 AM] <OwlLightningMage> A ROBOT LOVING A ROBOT MEANS NOTHING
[12/11/18, 12:47:37 AM] <SlightlySychotic> Kara could be completely removed from the game with no consequence.
[12/11/18, 12:47:37 AM] <smargh1015> Kara is a total waste of time
[12/11/18, 12:47:37 AM] <brambobelurkin> THEY CAN JUST FUCKING LOOK NORMAL WITHOUT RIPPING IT OFF?
[12/11/18, 12:47:37 AM] <Logan_Jennings1> I makes it FUCKING POINTLESS
[12/11/18, 12:47:38 AM] <SiameseSneeze> Did I miss the fucking end?
[12/11/18, 12:47:39 AM] <sackerkappa> Here's the trick question: Does Alice like Kara for real or was she programmed to like her?
[12/11/18, 12:47:40 AM] <Hadley> She made that picture with her head bleeding so I assumed Todd removed her LED
[12/11/18, 12:47:40 AM] <missingangle> Connor: A+, Marcus C, Kara: F----
[12/11/18, 12:47:41 AM] <krawtch> literally any defense for this terrible twist boils down to "BECAUSE, OKAY? SHUT UP"
[12/11/18, 12:47:41 AM] <SausageShogunate> the whole game should've just been aConnor and Hank buddy cop comedy
[12/11/18, 12:47:42 AM] <NWR_James> @CoalSavoie BUT ITS HERE NOW
[12/11/18, 12:47:42 AM] <GohanEgret> It would be more interesting if Kara never knew
[12/11/18, 12:47:44 AM] <rdark_ksu> Kara i'm cold. No you are not you literal example of a lie
[12/11/18, 12:47:44 AM] <ExpendableComicRelief> @NWR_James It's in one of the magazines, they can disable it in the kid lines.
[12/11/18, 12:47:45 AM] <Gruhunchously> Can a robot care for another robot
[12/11/18, 12:47:45 AM] <Laecerelius> I bet Tod is an Android too
[12/11/18, 12:47:45 AM] <MelodicCello> Honestly, just the fact that there are androids that are built to imitate A CHILD in this world is the most fucked up part about it. mathsquadNoDad
[12/11/18, 12:47:49 AM] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva this is like fucking like the origami killer reveal fucking scene
[12/11/18, 12:47:51 AM] <badchoice5> "Alice we called it" LUL
[12/11/18, 12:47:52 AM] <Kataguro> Why would she?
[12/11/18, 12:47:53 AM] <ZeOrbling> KARA ALREADY KNEW
[12/11/18, 12:47:53 AM] <OwlLightningMage> BECAUSE THE STORY IS STUPID
[12/11/18, 12:47:53 AM] <skizzuto> Is Alice even deviant?
[12/11/18, 12:47:53 AM] <cvp5127> his alice deviant?
[12/11/18, 12:47:53 AM] <sana_kan> because alice isn't deviant I guess?
[12/11/18, 12:47:53 AM] <ithonmage> Children don't have souls
[12/11/18, 12:47:55 AM] <Skeletorexplains> I thought the bitch went crazy with Mom.exe
[12/11/18, 12:47:56 AM] <Angry_Ev1L> IS ALICE EVEN A DEVIANT?\
[12/11/18, 12:47:57 AM] <Freelance7> KARA DID KNOW
[12/11/18, 12:47:58 AM] <krawtch> alice lies to put kara in danger
[12/11/18, 12:47:58 AM] <sosuke5> And Todd runs Asshole.exe
[12/11/18, 12:47:59 AM] <MSN04_Sazabi> ALICE IS NOT A DEVIANT SHE IS NOT SELF-AWARE
[12/11/18, 12:47:59 AM] <smargh1015> is alice even deviant?
[12/11/18, 12:47:59 AM] <lethallunacyx> stupid child .exe
[12/11/18, 12:47:59 AM] <GarbageQueenEllie> @MelodicCello YES
[12/11/18, 12:48:00 AM] <reonome> @CoalSavoie thats just a lying picture, in the character viewer they tell you child android leds can be deactivated
[12/11/18, 12:48:01 AM] <Graxe_> @PeachSaliva And Kara knew the entire time that Alice was a robot. Kara decided not to believe it.
[12/11/18, 12:48:02 AM] <OwlLightningMage> KARA IS STUPID
[12/11/18, 12:48:03 AM] <gyrogogozeppeli> YES
[12/11/18, 12:48:04 AM] <legendfather_of_giants> @PeachSaliva she doesnt want to admit it
[12/11/18, 12:48:04 AM] <Gruhunchously> She repressed the memory
[12/11/18, 12:48:04 AM] <TheA1ternative> KARA CHOSE TO FORGET
[12/11/18, 12:48:04 AM] <GohanEgret> willful ignorance
[12/11/18, 12:48:04 AM] <dansinginthestreet> my brain just swapped kara for chara
[12/11/18, 12:48:04 AM] <Dragon_Batman> Kara was in denial the whole time
[12/11/18, 12:48:05 AM] <galaxyswirl> @PeachSaliva you actually see a magazine for an alice bot at the beginning of the game
[12/11/18, 12:48:05 AM] <themagic_conch> she didnt want to know
[12/11/18, 12:48:06 AM] <Ell1ot> i would've liked it if the little girl was a Hooman
[12/11/18, 12:48:06 AM] <LiquidMathew> SHE MENTAL BLOCKED IT
[12/11/18, 12:48:06 AM] <HorseChange> It's a twist that Kara has been lying to herself and Alice willfully, because she wanted Alice to feel accepted among the humans?
[12/11/18, 12:48:06 AM] <The_Esquana> SHE CHOSE TO NOT AGKNOWLEDGE THE GLOWING LED
[12/11/18, 12:48:06 AM] <averagehero1> Child android is a super weapon that's the real plot twist
[12/11/18, 12:48:07 AM] <OwlLightningMage> IT'S SO STUPID
[12/11/18, 12:48:08 AM] <badchoice5> CAGE LIED TO YOU
[12/11/18, 12:48:09 AM] <AncelDeLambert> Alice can only be considered deviant if she shoots Todd
[12/11/18, 12:48:09 AM] <king_wragles> @PeachSaliva YOU'RE ACTUALLY ABOUT TO FIND OUT WHY ALICE DID THE THING
[12/11/18, 12:48:10 AM] <Sp3ctre48> It's such a pointless twist, the game would have been fine without it
[12/11/18, 12:48:12 AM] <Endocrom> There's also the possibility that Alice might not even BE a deviant
[12/11/18, 12:48:12 AM] <Toynota10> NO SHUT UP
[12/11/18, 12:48:12 AM] <AXL808> Kara blocked her own mind
[12/11/18, 12:48:12 AM] <Bouldus> Kara read the receipt for alace @PeachSaliva
[12/11/18, 12:48:13 AM] <booglesnurf> Davidcage dot exe
[12/11/18, 12:48:13 AM] <rdark_ksu> Why do you keep feeding me? This pasta is tangling my servos
[12/11/18, 12:48:13 AM] <gyrogogozeppeli> SHE WAS DEVIANT BEFORE SHE WAS ACTUALLY DEVIANT
[12/11/18, 12:48:15 AM] <Logan_Jennings1> THE GAME SAID NO YOU DON'T KNOW
[12/11/18, 12:48:15 AM] <skm742> WHY DID LUTHER PREPARE A SPEECH?!?!?
[12/11/18, 12:48:15 AM] <mercado94> It was againts the Prime Directive
[12/11/18, 12:48:15 AM] <barretzm> I don't think Alice is a deviant
[12/11/18, 12:48:16 AM] <sana_kan> it seems like the game implies that alice is basically just a regular ass android that has no actual autonomy unlike kara or markus
[12/11/18, 12:48:16 AM] <Jontman42> She wanted to believe
[12/11/18, 12:48:17 AM] <Keyd00d> BUT!
[12/11/18, 12:48:17 AM] <moranprime> Bad writing is bad
[12/11/18, 12:48:17 AM] <TheMilhouseExperience> She repressed her memory because REASONS.
[12/11/18, 12:48:18 AM] <badchoice5> YOU GOT CAGED
[12/11/18, 12:48:18 AM] <Klarrann3> THE MAGAZINE IN TODD'S ROOM
[12/11/18, 12:48:18 AM] <smargh1015> just like manfred in HR
[12/11/18, 12:48:18 AM] <averagehero1> Kara just ignored it the WHOLE time
[12/11/18, 12:48:19 AM] <MightyMaxT> What if Child Androids were programmed to think they're real
[12/11/18, 12:48:20 AM] <LiquidMathew> SHE BLOCKED IT
[12/11/18, 12:48:21 AM] <SubjectTea> NO SHUT UP PAIGE
[12/11/18, 12:48:21 AM] <Hadley> She forgot because PLOT
[12/11/18, 12:48:21 AM] <Kataguro> I must take care of CHILD because I am VVYMYN
[12/11/18, 12:48:23 AM] <BioApple> The evidence seems to suggest children are deliberately programmed to not know they are robots, which makes no sense
[12/11/18, 12:48:25 AM] <arcaderabbit48> Kara was like "Dont let it set in"
[12/11/18, 12:48:25 AM] <JenovasPuppet> Eet mahks sehns!
[12/11/18, 12:48:27 AM] <captainspauldin> lol
[12/11/18, 12:48:27 AM] <emoonimoo> I was under the impression at first that Alice had no idea she was a robot and that's why she acted all helpless and shit
[12/11/18, 12:48:27 AM] <Hilleltaco> She just didn't want to SEE IT maaaaan, such a good TWIST maaaaan ResidentSleeper
[12/11/18, 12:48:27 AM] <Gruhunchously> Is Alice a deviant?
[12/11/18, 12:48:27 AM] <Divryne> GET CAGED BEEYATCH.
[12/11/18, 12:48:29 AM] <duneblythe> alice didn't want to be rejected

[12/11/18, 12:48:30 AM] <HorseChange> REMEMBER HER DREAM OF THE UNICORN
[12/11/18, 12:48:30 AM] <Maki_risu> SELECTIVE MEMORY, BUT FOR ROBOTS
[12/11/18, 12:48:31 AM] <booglesnurf> Is that the script over there?
[12/11/18, 12:48:32 AM] <gyrogogozeppeli> SHE WAS DEVIANT BEFORE SHE WAS ACTUALLY DEVIANT!
[12/11/18, 12:48:35 AM] <lethallunacyx> so then Kara is inferior to people
[12/11/18, 12:48:35 AM] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva She saw the magazine, knew, but then was like "She needs me to protect her. So I will think of her as hooman"
[12/11/18, 12:48:35 AM] <PDS6400> That's Right Jay!
[12/11/18, 12:48:37 AM] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva she IS THE REAAL ORIGAMI KILLER
[12/11/18, 12:48:37 AM] <californaya> Paige is such a mood right now
[12/11/18, 12:48:38 AM] <circular7> she wanted to be a mommy
[12/11/18, 12:48:38 AM] <st_jimmy456> it's okay to be mad. it's fucking awful
[12/11/18, 12:48:40 AM] <AXL808> The magazine is blurred out
[12/11/18, 12:48:40 AM] <moranprime> Can we punch giant bugs in a office again Pat?
[12/11/18, 12:48:41 AM] <Dr_mr_wang> is Alice deviant? i guess she's whatever the script needs her to be, what's that? is that the script?
[12/11/18, 12:48:43 AM] <krawtch> how come the police report didnt mention two androids.
[12/11/18, 12:48:44 AM] <deviljhojho94> Christ
[12/11/18, 12:48:45 AM] <averagehero1> Kara ignored the rampaging elephant in the room
[12/11/18, 12:48:46 AM] <Skeletorexplains> STOLEN CHILD
[12/11/18, 12:48:47 AM] <3InchMensch> THIS MEANS KARA HAD TO HAVE BEEN A DEVIANT FROM THE MOMENT SHE WAS REACTIVATED
[12/11/18, 12:48:47 AM] <ExpendableComicRelief> OMEGALUL
[12/11/18, 12:48:48 AM] <MrDonTacos_> The answer to every "but?" question is: CAGE LUL

[12/11/18, 12:48:59 AM] <TheMilhouseExperience> And Todd died for Nothing.
[12/11/18, 12:49:00 AM] <krawtch> if both of your TVs get stolen, do you only report one of them?
[12/11/18, 12:49:00 AM] <lightsinx98> Kara wholes story is a literal waste of time
[12/11/18, 12:49:01 AM] <AncelDeLambert> god Cage is garbage
[12/11/18, 12:49:01 AM] <juxtest> Connor was also in denial about Alice being an android

[12/11/18, 12:49:10 AM] <HorseChange> Was Luther just building up that big speech?
[12/11/18, 12:49:11 AM] <averagehero1> TODD BOUGHT A MINI TOASTER CHILD
[12/11/18, 12:49:12 AM] <gyrogogozeppeli> LUTHER DONT ENABLE HER
[12/11/18, 12:49:13 AM] <Rhinoprotoss> Luther tried
[12/11/18, 12:49:16 AM] <booglesnurf> Is robo Alice replacing fambily?
[12/11/18, 12:49:18 AM] <Estuko> Luther: I thought this was an open RP
[12/11/18, 12:49:19 AM] <rdark_ksu> Luther didnt want to get stabbed by a crazy bitch in his sleep
[12/11/18, 12:49:19 AM] <DatAsuna> He actually isn't
[12/11/18, 12:49:19 AM] <Sinister_Aglet> Luther thought it was funny
[12/11/18, 12:49:19 AM] <timblenaut> Luther tries to tell her
[12/11/18, 12:49:21 AM] <MightyMaxT> He "tries" a couple times
[12/11/18, 12:49:21 AM] <Logan_Jennings1> He tried a few times but not very hard
[12/11/18, 12:49:23 AM] <3InchMensch> He did try a few times to tell Kara
[12/11/18, 12:49:24 AM] <BioApple> JERRY JERICHO
[12/11/18, 12:49:25 AM] <DatAsuna> He tries to tell her IN THAT SCENE
[12/11/18, 12:49:26 AM] <cherubsanonymous> This is everything I hoped it would be
[12/11/18, 12:49:26 AM] <RollCritFail> Luther is playing along Just for Alice and Kara <3
[12/11/18, 12:49:26 AM] <Skeletorexplains> WE GOTTA HELP THIS CHILD SMILE
[12/11/18, 12:49:27 AM] <Kataguro> He keeps trying to because Kara is legitimately crazy

[12/11/18, 12:49:30 AM] <barretzm> Luther likes crazy bitches
[12/11/18, 12:49:31 AM] <Yumonikki> Jerry.
[12/11/18, 12:49:31 AM] <LiquidMathew> Jerrys are kinda dumb
[12/11/18, 12:49:32 AM] <clonexsniperx> everyone knows
[12/11/18, 12:49:33 AM] <DatAsuna> Kara's just a bitch
[12/11/18, 12:49:33 AM] <king_wragles> TODD BOUGHT ROBOTS TO TURN ON HIS VACUUM ROBOT
[12/11/18, 12:49:33 AM] <moranprime> Because bad writing
[12/11/18, 12:49:33 AM] <spire6> Luther lies: A WH40K story
[12/11/18, 12:49:33 AM] <HorseChange> OH GOD. Luther.. Ending speech about connections between people.... Please no
[12/11/18, 12:49:33 AM] <AncelDeLambert> Luther is an idiot, he has no reason to actually go along with Kara's crap
[12/11/18, 12:49:34 AM] <Logan_Jennings1> No
[12/11/18, 12:49:34 AM] <DedlokPM> @PeachSaliva HE TRIED TO TELL HER> MANY TIMES! BUT KARA KEPT SAYING "WE WILL TALK LATER!"
[12/11/18, 12:49:34 AM] <OwlLightningMage> EVERYONE KNOW AND SAID NOTHING
[12/11/18, 12:49:35 AM] <lethallunacyx> probably
[12/11/18, 12:49:36 AM] <energywarning> luther did nothing wrong. don't you bring him into this
[12/11/18, 12:49:36 AM] <AXL808> he pitted Kara
[12/11/18, 12:49:37 AM] <arcaderabbit48> Its actually really creepy when you start peeling the layers back. Like, Kara is broken as a person and Luthor just goes along with her delusions
[12/11/18, 12:49:38 AM] <OwlLightningMage> IT'S SO STUPID
[12/11/18, 12:49:39 AM] <badchoice5> THEY CAN SPEAK MIND-TO-MIND

[12/11/18, 12:49:44 AM] <JDebss> Todd didn't know they're sentient either so not evil.
[12/11/18, 12:49:45 AM] <sackerkappa> Luther even tried telling Kara about Alice but then was stopped.
[12/11/18, 12:49:45 AM] <JenovasPuppet> "It's been so long since we've seen one!"
[12/11/18, 12:49:46 AM] <Graxe_> Robots can still freeze, like the Jerries. Sure they don't need shelter, but they need some minimal warmth.
[12/11/18, 12:49:49 AM] <Dragon_Batman> I don't think those guys knew a dam thing
[12/11/18, 12:49:51 AM] <averagehero1> Jerry needes customers even if they aren't real children

[12/11/18, 12:50:01 AM] <booglesnurf> All androids look the same
[12/11/18, 12:50:01 AM] <Laironx3> Luther wanted to warn you about the dumb plot twist.
[12/11/18, 12:50:03 AM] <SSaryn> And we maybe only see like 30-50 different types in the game.
[12/11/18, 12:50:05 AM] <OwlLightningMage> EVERYONE KNEW
[12/11/18, 12:50:07 AM] <duneblythe> Jerry didn't know shit

[12/11/18, 12:50:15 AM] <HorseChange> LUTHER provides the most insiteful SPEECH in the game.
[12/11/18, 12:50:16 AM] <lightsinx98> HE IS A TAXI DRIVER
[12/11/18, 12:50:16 AM] <GarbageQueenEllie> He just spends all his cash on VICTIMS

[12/11/18, 12:50:55 AM] <pleasenameyourcharacter> That's fucked up american wellfare for ya.
[12/11/18, 12:50:55 AM] <heyitsbrian> CAPS LOCK IS CRUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
[12/11/18, 12:50:56 AM] <arcaderabbit48> Yeah, Red Ice just kinda stops mattering.
[12/11/18, 12:50:57 AM] <Toynota10> Have there been any interviews with David Cage about this?
[12/11/18, 12:50:58 AM] <HorseChange> Drugs are bad
[12/11/18, 12:51:00 AM] <CoalSavoie> If he IS a dealer, he's a shitty one
[12/11/18, 12:51:00 AM] <Dr_mr_wang> she never found the drugs
[12/11/18, 12:51:01 AM] <Huntercd> I am remembering why I hate this and Cage
[12/11/18, 12:51:02 AM] <leadenstrides> He also spends a lot of money on drugs.
[12/11/18, 12:51:03 AM] <Chalupa2474> LOL @ROOMBA HAHA
[12/11/18, 12:51:04 AM] <TheA1ternative> CARLS SON IS ON RED ICE
[12/11/18, 12:51:04 AM] <LiquidMathew> Its just a background detail
[12/11/18, 12:51:05 AM] <FrostMass22> The drugs don't matter
[12/11/18, 12:51:06 AM] <Neo_Kaiser> and they have a roomba
[12/11/18, 12:51:08 AM] <DOOOOOOOO000OOM> THE DRUGS PLOT GOES NOWHERE
[12/11/18, 12:51:08 AM] <AXL808> drugs just a red herring
[12/11/18, 12:51:11 AM] <emoonimoo> Red Ice is mentioned a small amount of times
[12/11/18, 12:51:11 AM] <californaya> is it????
[12/11/18, 12:51:12 AM] <lethallunacyx> gotta get that red ice
[12/11/18, 12:51:13 AM] <cvp5127> ZLATKO
[12/11/18, 12:51:14 AM] <person181> connors first case had some laying around
[12/11/18, 12:51:14 AM] <averagehero1> After the first act red ice becomes nonexistent
[12/11/18, 12:51:15 AM] <SSaryn> IT'S ALMOST LIKE THEY SHOULD HAVE FOLLOWED THAT ONE PLOT LINE INSTEAD OF NOT AT ALL
[12/11/18, 12:51:15 AM] <Rhinoprotoss> It's part of Hank's child death thing
[12/11/18, 12:51:16 AM] <Joey_JoestarXD> It was probably dreoppped
[12/11/18, 12:51:16 AM] <Twoiis> There is another important one.
[12/11/18, 12:51:18 AM] <rdark_ksu> The unemployment is like 40% what else you gonna do but get high?
[12/11/18, 12:51:18 AM] <badchoice5> But no, Sex Bots
[12/11/18, 12:51:18 AM] <walternatorz> they were harvesting them
[12/11/18, 12:51:19 AM] <Blankets_and_Tea> this game's just like "yeah drugs are a think i guess"
[12/11/18, 12:51:21 AM] <BioApple> Androids are cheaper than my PC, do you think I could get Doom to run on one?
[12/11/18, 12:51:21 AM] <Gruhunchously> Kind of like how impending World War 3 just stops being important
[12/11/18, 12:51:21 AM] <HorseChange> It's "world building".
[12/11/18, 12:51:21 AM] <Mr_Strut> Needs more super meth
[12/11/18, 12:51:21 AM] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Probably wasn't Cage's idea is why it's interesting
[12/11/18, 12:51:21 AM] <krawtch> despite containing "android blood" its chemical composition is the same as cocaine
[12/11/18, 12:51:22 AM] <walternatorz> zlatko
[12/11/18, 12:51:25 AM] <G_Lancaster> harvesting thing is literally deus ex @PeachSaliva
[12/11/18, 12:51:26 AM] <Logan_Jennings1> This game has so much potential to be interesting and does nothing with it.
[12/11/18, 12:51:27 AM] <SlightlySychotic> I mean, it would make more sense if Todd was screwing Kara. Full surrogate family thing.
[12/11/18, 12:51:38 AM] <krawtch> zlatko did nothing wrong
[12/11/18, 12:51:39 AM] <averagehero1> SCREW ROBO DRUGS WE NEED ROBO RIGHTS
[12/11/18, 12:51:40 AM] <TalisKanju> Did Paige finish Detroit?
[12/11/18, 12:51:40 AM] <booglesnurf> THATS RIGHT COLLIN
[12/11/18, 12:51:41 AM] <circular7> drugs are bad - cage
[12/11/18, 12:51:42 AM] <lethallunacyx> shhh don't think
[12/11/18, 12:51:42 AM] <joylent_blue> ITS ALMOST LIKE THERE COULD BE A BETTER GAME HIDDEN IN THIS SHIT

[12/11/18, 12:51:45 AM] <cvp5127> is alice even a deviant?
[12/11/18, 12:51:46 AM] <Graxe_> The drug plot goes nowhere, just like the Arctic conflict with Russia.
[12/11/18, 12:51:47 AM] <gyrogogozeppeli> AS YOU SHOULD
[12/11/18, 12:51:47 AM] <Hilleltaco> At least there's always Connor
[12/11/18, 12:51:48 AM] <krawtch> all fat evils are just fat neutrals
[12/11/18, 12:51:48 AM] <Mr_Strut> This is why you enslave the robots
[12/11/18, 12:51:49 AM] <californaya> That's the spirit!
[12/11/18, 12:51:51 AM] <AncelDeLambert> No, Zlatko liked modifying shit
[12/11/18, 12:51:51 AM] <themagic_conch> luthers cool tho
[12/11/18, 12:51:51 AM] <reonome> care about connor
[12/11/18, 12:51:51 AM] <Sphincter_Spelunker> Or it was Cage's idea and he can't execute for shit
[12/11/18, 12:51:51 AM] <Mirrorcatch> probably edited out that red ice is supernatural or whatever
[12/11/18, 12:51:52 AM] <Ropcord> HEY CONNOR IS COOL
[12/11/18, 12:51:53 AM] <averagehero1> Good paige good
[12/11/18, 12:51:55 AM] <TheMilhouseExperience> Rage against the Cage.

[12/11/18, 12:51:57 AM] <Hadley> Don't comfort the child
[12/11/18, 12:51:58 AM] <Laecerelius> There’s a dump full of robots full of precious drug materials

[12/11/18, 12:51:58 AM] <lethallunacyx> FUN!
[12/11/18, 12:52:01 AM] <JenovasPuppet> Yes
[12/11/18, 12:52:02 AM] <DatAsuna> Alice is deviant since before kara
[12/11/18, 12:52:02 AM] <3InchMensch> IS SHE?
[12/11/18, 12:52:02 AM] <LumberjackJack> Ugh, don't remind me of ME3 again BibleThump
[12/11/18, 12:52:02 AM] <OwlLightningMage> MASS EFFECT 3'S ENDING IS TRASH
[12/11/18, 12:52:04 AM] <Dragon_Batman> kinda yea

[12/11/18, 12:52:08 AM] <AncelDeLambert> we don't know
[12/11/18, 12:52:09 AM] <Plutt_bug> FUCK THIS
[12/11/18, 12:52:09 AM] <KevinsLunchbox> Kara tells Zlatko Alice is human and Zlatkos reaction is "holy shit this robot is deviant as fuck!"
[12/11/18, 12:52:09 AM] <Luesagna00> @peachsaliva just as bad as origami killer reveal
[12/11/18, 12:52:10 AM] <PDS6400> THAT'S RIGHT JAY
[12/11/18, 12:52:11 AM] <JDebss> Naw
[12/11/18, 12:52:12 AM] <GarbageQueenEllie> Kara was in denial cause she knows it's just as much bullshit as you do
[12/11/18, 12:52:12 AM] <DatAsuna> yes she is
[12/11/18, 12:52:13 AM] <deviljhojho94> I WILL NEVER NOT BE MAD ABOUT ME3
[12/11/18, 12:52:14 AM] <mercado94> BIG MAYBE
[12/11/18, 12:52:14 AM] <theobble> Alice kept it a secret intentionally because she was "afraid kara wouldn't love me anymore" (ACTUAL QUOTE IN GAME)
[12/11/18, 12:52:14 AM] <rdark_ksu> got hit so hard she got awakened
[12/11/18, 12:52:15 AM] <HorseChange> this ending ages really poorly. Damn
[12/11/18, 12:52:15 AM] <JenovasPuppet> Alice couldn't have left her master if she wasn't a deviant
[12/11/18, 12:52:15 AM] <fingalights> But they don't know about her
[12/11/18, 12:52:15 AM] <DracaenaLeaf> She probably isn't a deviant, but acts like a child any way
[12/11/18, 12:52:16 AM] <gyrogogozeppeli> LUL
[12/11/18, 12:52:16 AM] <Sphincter_Spelunker> The only good part of ME3 is the horde mode
[12/11/18, 12:52:16 AM] <AlasterAngelo> THAT'S RIGHT JAY
[12/11/18, 12:52:17 AM] <Estuko> She turned deviant when Todd performed Raging Demon on her
[12/11/18, 12:52:17 AM] <MrBorisMakarov> alice is deviant but couldn't really do anything about it
[12/11/18, 12:52:17 AM] <DatAsuna> She leaves you notes and shit
[12/11/18, 12:52:17 AM] <3InchMensch> PAT'S RIGHT!

[12/11/18, 12:52:22 AM] <SuichiTanaka> LUL
[12/11/18, 12:52:23 AM] <BioApple> They wouldn't locate Alice since she wasn't on the police report as an android
[12/11/18, 12:52:23 AM] <RantingRavager> THAT'S RIGHT JAY
[12/11/18, 12:52:23 AM] <OwlLightningMage> MASS EFFECT 3'S ENDING GETS WORSE THE MORE YOU THINK ABOUT IT
[12/11/18, 12:52:24 AM] <Yumonikki> YOU HAVE TO

[12/11/18, 1:00:17 AM] <Alpha820> Dirty bombs are not what people think they are. Certainly not what David Cage thinks. They're fairly useless as a weapon of mass destruction.

[12/11/18, 1:21:30 AM] <GarbageQueenEllie> This isn't a game about nothing. SEINFELD is a game about nothing
[12/11/18, 1:21:33 AM] <sana_kan> I mean it's so muddled there really isn't anyway

[12/11/18, 1:21:41 AM] <smargh1015> is David cage a bigger coward than Todd?
[12/11/18, 1:21:46 AM] <baronvonkame> the weirder options work out because cage HAD to make a scenario where everyone lives; thus all characters with a "save" option must be a QTE to save
[12/11/18, 1:21:49 AM] <pleasenameyourcharacter> A moment of silence for our American heroes who died trying to stop the toaster menace...
[12/11/18, 1:21:51 AM] <lightsinx98> There IS a concentration camp

[12/11/18, 1:22:06 AM] <BioApple> I hope this game doesn't have a message because right now its message seems to be "concentration camps are illogical, just shoot all your enemies asap"
[12/11/18, 1:22:06 AM] <happyface699> @negativejam Toasters fuck ovens
[12/11/18, 1:22:06 AM] <moranprime> Story boarding this game must've been a nightmare.

[12/11/18, 1:22:49 AM] <lightsinx98> you can leave kara in the concentration camp
[12/11/18, 1:22:49 AM] <krawtch> Kara's story literally does not matter in this game whatsoever
[12/11/18, 1:22:49 AM] <Hadley> Why does it matter she's a toaster child
[12/11/18, 1:22:49 AM] <barretzm> Who cares

[12/11/18, 1:23:01 AM] <gyrogogozeppeli> only peopel who care about Alice are easily swayed idiots
[12/11/18, 1:23:02 AM] <krawtch> Kara dying at Todds house changes nothing

[12/11/18, 1:23:10 AM] <alexandrecau> fbi bad guy is replacement connor right? so for optimal story connor should be a machine
[12/11/18, 1:23:12 AM] <FrostMass22> Alice dying is the most interesting thing she can do
[12/11/18, 1:23:16 AM] <Gruhunchously> I'm an easily swayed idiot...
[12/11/18, 1:23:21 AM] <G_Lancaster> If Alice dies in game YOU DIE in real life

[12/11/18, 1:23:30 AM] <averagehero1> Kara will protect her NES mini at all cost
[12/11/18, 1:23:30 AM] <lightsinx98> you can ditch alice in the camp and leave her to die
