[18-11-8 07:49:48] <JustJaackla> @Champez2014 No its the 19th, and the game you can play tomorrow with origin premier
[18-11-8 07:49:50] <Spartan11B1P> You'd probably get shot in the ass a lot, but it seems possible
[18-11-8 07:50:03] <BluesPlays> you have to kill like 30 people in the tutorial LUL

[18-11-8 08:14:34] <Fuse404> They spend all that time building up a big mood with the intro. Then you have to back out to fix the settings. FailFish

[18-11-8 08:14:55] <42ndBot> Sacriel is using RDFG as his movement keys in most games so he can have access to more keys to the left on the keyboard. https://clips.twitch.tv/HappyFreezingBaconPRChase

[18-11-8 08:15:06] <MatthewTimeGaming> Does Battlefield V have a BR mode?
[18-11-8 08:15:08] <MownarN> available
[18-11-8 08:15:10] <Dragoonseal> MownarN no
[18-11-8 08:15:13] <fluxsta> Guys if anyone is interested, on Battlenet, if you didn't know. Destiny 2 is free for PC atm. (I think it's still active)

[18-11-8 08:15:25] <GenuineRNG> @Nerepla350 ah alright :)
[18-11-8 08:15:30] <Bellosster> music is epic
[18-11-8 08:15:33] <johnnyarks> Does BFV have a single player?
[18-11-8 08:15:36] <MatthewTimeGaming> why isn't it available wtf
[18-11-8 08:15:40] <Nikolai_Von_Imhof> @johnnyarks Yes and no, but understandable. If you only plan on playing here and there it is good. So you can pay say $60 a year for multiple games, or pay full price for the game all at once.
[18-11-8 08:15:40] <MownarN> March really?

[18-11-8 09:00:03] <scrottyc> "Think they've nerfed tanks"
[18-11-8 09:00:03] <GeeK_Batman> AP in games generally means anti personnel and AT means anti tank, makes it easier for people to understand

[18-11-8 09:04:49] <Microchaton> that's a good thing tho
[18-11-8 09:04:49] <Anthony10002> people were using the tank's MG before they even nerf it LUL
[18-11-8 09:04:49] <GriffGoodman> a tank shell should kill wtf LUL
[18-11-8 09:04:53] <BumrushBill> might just be damage falloff? so that tanks actually have to move into the fight rather than snipe
[18-11-8 09:04:56] <Kappa563> wasn't there two types of ammo in tanks ?
[18-11-8 09:05:00] <snuggans> their tank is probably at C

[18-11-8 09:05:04] <Seandoran19> Would be a little op if all those shells one shot though

[18-11-8 09:05:15] <Mirnic9801> @sacriel might be fall off damage and AP founds
[18-11-8 09:05:16] <GriffGoodman> it has a fast fire rate tho
[18-11-8 09:05:24] <ultimatekctv> It's literally an AT gun too. this is the 40mm variant. That's some big ass bullet for 70 damage
[18-11-8 09:05:24] <GreenMan35> danSmile just getting hit directly by a explosive shell, no prob.
[18-11-8 09:05:33] <Sir_Matticus_> Better off just using the aux

[18-11-8 09:05:42] <Phy3eri> @ShannonZKiller when did they change the time? i still have the countdown after restart. (i can launch now tho)
[18-11-8 09:05:50] <ミッチ> the germans are absolute units, imagine taking a tank shell to the body forsenKek
[18-11-8 09:06:04] <ShannonZKiller> Phy3eri i dont have that answer. youll have to ask EA.
[18-11-8 09:06:08] <rehal47> A tank shell should blow the body into million pieces
[18-11-8 09:06:10] <BumrushBill> im sorry but am i the only one that thinks it would be really cheesy if a tank can sit in the back of the map and oneshot you?
[18-11-8 09:06:10] <timmeh1901> they should make it that direct hits still kill, but keep the explsion and splash damage as it is now

[18-11-8 09:14:19] <BumrushBill> sniping was so satisfying in this game though

[18-11-8 09:14:29] <Bigbatty> the snipe changes in Beta were amazing, why did they revert it?
[18-11-8 09:14:32] <JoeMountain> Maybe remove all maps
[18-11-8 09:14:35] <fluxsta> They should at least add an item where you can remove it.
[18-11-8 09:14:44] <johnnyarks> they make 10KW light bulbs?
[18-11-8 09:14:44] <NostromosUK> Why did they not have it in the open beta and then add it in afterwards, thats what I hate

[18-11-8 09:54:59] <Microchaton> If you have Premier but do not buy the Deluxe edition, do you still get 6 paratroopers sets, deluxe special assignements and the weekly bonus items?
[18-11-8 09:55:00] <Madtown_Maverick> @idolen_ Premier is today as well
[18-11-8 09:55:00] <Skapolith> best answer @Sacriel u just questioned every word in the question xD
[18-11-8 09:55:15] <Madtown_Maverick> @Microchaton yup
[18-11-8 09:55:15] <Mischiefbear> @idolen_ yes but I think it opened today as a surprise. Don't think this is streamer specific
[18-11-8 09:55:15] <kenxxys> this map is dope
[18-11-8 09:55:17] <rocketmunkey> @BigTiddyBawls feels like it, especially after the weekly reset. So many activities!
[18-11-8 09:55:17] <espbeetle> U.S. and U.K. I believe had a few differences in our codes as well back then
[18-11-8 09:55:25] <idolen_> @Madtown_Maverick insane, so people get to play 1 week before actual SUPPORTERS, for the development of the game.
[18-11-8 09:55:27] <RedFoxx777> Skill gap is pretty high in this game compared to BF1. Jackfrags had a lot of good things to say about the gameplay
[18-11-8 09:55:35] <FluffyAbsol> @idolen_ I can play it as well and I don#t strema.

[18-11-8 09:59:06] <rocketmunkey> @trivialmind no, just in general, movement is slower paced. But it has different maps, whereas Vermintide is always "go go go", OTWD has some maps where it's just survive the horde

[18-11-8 10:00:04] <rocketmunkey> @trivialmind so it's not a straight comparison with Vermintide. Just the feeling I got watching it was that it was a slower-paced Vermintide
[18-11-8 10:00:05] <Rustles2> I guess that's why we couldn't find him in the wild west, he was here the whole time

[18-11-8 10:11:01] <Dragoonseal> @arrayarc The game has HDR, it comes through on the stream just fine. When he's in a dark room and walks out into the sun it's bright and washed out for a few moments. But the effect looked pretty gross on this map for some reason
[18-11-8 10:11:02] <Giincat> How good/bad is the game so far?
[18-11-8 10:11:03] <fluxsta> What does that mean lol ?

[18-11-8 10:13:22] <Dragoonseal> @arrayarc it's literately called HDR in the options. And it's been in games for like 10 years. It's not as good as the true HDR you can get from monitors that support it these days, it's just an aproximation of the effect. Never looks particularly great, some games do it better than others
[18-11-8 10:13:23] <slugginn1> Translation “I eat ass”

[18-11-8 10:39:40] <Microchaton> I think it's an understandable change

[18-11-8 10:39:47] <SRJ_009> !42nd
[18-11-8 10:39:47] <Lemings> They should make it so it only restricts changing to the winning team. People on the winning team can still swap to the losing one

[18-11-8 10:41:46] <UnicornBrothels> if you cancel Premier, you wouldn't lose any progress, right? just the perks of Premier?

[18-11-8 10:41:58] <ShannonZKiller> not sure on that UnicornBrothels
[18-11-8 10:42:01] <originaltimeline> Origin premier is actual worth btw if you're gonna play more than 1 origin game
[18-11-8 10:42:03] <gigglz> Grand Operations?? Cool
[18-11-8 10:42:04] <Lemings> UnicornBrothels Yep
[18-11-8 10:42:05] <FluffyAbsol> @UnicornBrothels Right.
[18-11-8 10:42:05] <Crasherated> In five months I feel like all the work for the br will have gone to waste

[18-11-8 10:42:28] <doobyscoo> @Lemings Yeah but they have advertised it alot and used it in marketing. For it to be 5 months away seems weird

[18-11-8 10:47:58] <Ponssek> I have a question about Origin premium... do you have to buy the game to play early or by just paying the monthly amount you get the game?

[18-11-8 10:49:48] <Dragoonseal> vicious_dude sac7
[18-11-8 10:49:48] <Lemings> doobyscoo Lack of communication? No idea what you mean, they said a bunch of things about the game beforehand. Misleading information? You mean people wanting something, expecting it as confirmed, then when the game comes out and it's not in because the devs never said anything like it they are butthurt? Negative response from the general public? You mean those kids shouting -banned word- based on the very first trailer like some 10years olds?

[18-11-8 10:50:08] <BlueFox805> its a bit odd to me when it moves, InvictusAIE

[18-11-8 10:51:22] <MiseryArse> Don't tar me as a stream sniper - as soon as i realised i was in their server i quit. Certainly wasn't intentional - there arent that many servers to go on with a low ping
[18-11-8 10:51:23] <ShannonZKiller> center chest like john wick

[18-11-8 10:51:46] <BlueFox805> complaining about realism in a viddy game is pretty silly imo. Not everything has to be a simulation

[18-11-8 10:51:52] <doobyscoo> @Lemings There were multipule occasions when they said things would or wouldnt be at launch and it was the opposite. There have been so many negative things about the game so far.
[18-11-8 10:51:52] <Dron3TV> @Sacriel turn off MAA
[18-11-8 10:51:52] <Lalister> How to play it today?
[18-11-8 10:51:53] <Lemings> WinterwolfEU Sensitive atmosphere? So what about those many games which covered WW2 in the past? CoD2, BF1942, Day of Infamy. Those weren't magically cried about for being WW2
[18-11-8 10:51:54] <HungryforSomething> oof

[18-11-8 10:52:03] <WinterwolfEU> @pykseldot Yeah but its just more of the fact every WW2 game so far has had pretty much the same atmosphere, going against that with such an iconic game that would fit the era is just weird.

[18-11-8 10:52:46] <pykseldot> @WinterwolfEU I don't disagree that I was hoping they would go more modern with the franchise for this next installment but that doesn't immediately make it a bad game.

[18-11-8 10:53:29] <WinterwolfEU> @Lemings CoD2 BF1942 never went to the "lesser" known battles and decided to make the Battlefield consist of 50% females or completely skip D-day. BFV skipping D-day completely for what purpose? showing Narvik and Norway's involvement?
[18-11-8 10:53:29] <Dragoonseal> @ShaddyDaShadow he never turned it on

[18-11-8 10:55:03] <WinterwolfEU> @FluffyAbsol Extremely unlikely that D-day is in the game given the fact it hasnt been marketed or even mentioned despite being one of the most iconic moments in history.
[18-11-8 10:55:03] <thrashpie88> Ha,
[18-11-8 10:55:04] <ShaddyDaShadow> @Dragoonseal oh ok I just joined in at that moment so lol
[18-11-8 10:55:06] <The1Specialist> Nasty!
[18-11-8 10:55:06] <undeaddub> Its an Ultra rare shiny medic
[18-11-8 10:55:06] <Connatic> @WinterwolfEU So I guess you never played the first CoD ;D Of course it WAS campaign based
[18-11-8 10:55:15] <SilentVelocityUK> @Sacriel new eft patch and wipe today, you gonna be jumping into it again this wipe?
[18-11-8 10:55:15] <Nuugi> @MiseryArse welcome to the twitch (chat) LUL
[18-11-8 10:55:22] <Caseysbro> how do you think the m1a1 carbine handles @Sacriel
[18-11-8 10:55:27] <jakeDxray> wups
[18-11-8 10:55:28] <Catkillerfive> *flop*
[18-11-8 10:55:30] <The1Specialist> That was a great pistol head shot when you turned that corner
[18-11-8 10:55:33] <pecky95> go sniper?
[18-11-8 10:55:34] <doobyscoo> @Lemings It takes just a quick scroll through any battlefield youtubers videos to see all the problems.
[18-11-8 10:55:36] <BlueFox805> If you're not a medic, you don't get to complain about there being no medics, IMO
[18-11-8 10:55:36] <blue_fist75> I like this map wasnt this one in the beta?
[18-11-8 10:55:36] <FluffyAbsol> @WinterwolfEU They haven't marketed any American involvement, yet.
[18-11-8 10:55:38] <lightsouttxx> beta??
[18-11-8 10:55:38] <WinterwolfEU> @Lemings It was never marketed as alternate history, it was marketed as showing the lesser known "facts" of the war. Youre calling me an incel over the internet on a twitch chat? I wonder who's one lmao hostile much
[18-11-8 10:55:50] <undeaddub> So crap??
[18-11-8 10:55:51] <ShannonZKiller> i've always liked the word carbine. satisfying word.
[18-11-8 10:56:01] <lightsouttxx> @Sacriel early release?
[18-11-8 10:56:02] <pykseldot> @doobyscoo so you're basing your feedback on heresay, thereby propagating the problem.
[18-11-8 10:56:03] <Connatic> D-day has been done to death, who cares. I'd rather do something different
[18-11-8 10:56:03] <szabikkkka> uhhh the garand
[18-11-8 10:56:10] <BlueFox805> could you have picked a less important thing to arge about? good lord get lives.
[18-11-8 10:56:14] <burgardorf> @WinterwolfEU It was marked as their take on WW2
[18-11-8 10:56:18] <ShannonZKiller> WinterwolfEU Lemings cmon guys..
[18-11-8 10:56:20] <burgardorf> marketed*
[18-11-8 10:56:20] <MajorFoley> So the changes they made from Beta, how are they?
[18-11-8 10:56:20] <MiseryArse> @Nuugi been a member for a while now lol
[18-11-8 10:56:21] <Dragoonseal> This gun seems really weak
[18-11-8 10:56:24] <Connatic> not everyone wants to relive their childhood until the end of time
[18-11-8 10:56:27] <Kaplanx5> thst looks sick if you get in cover
[18-11-8 10:56:29] <szabikkkka> @Connatic id love a dday operation..
[18-11-8 10:56:38] <Venturchiks> SO MANY
[18-11-8 10:56:39] <Randy_2020> Buy or Nay?
[18-11-8 10:56:39] <WinterwolfEU> @Connatic So because the initial CODs were campaign based over a decade ago that makes the entire franchise invested in it? The multiplayer has been the go to selling point for many many years, skipping a campaign was a decision they made because it wasnt profitable to keep based on the past 3 entries.
[18-11-8 10:56:41] <Venturchiks> Holy shit
[18-11-8 10:56:43] <typehazard> @Sacriel do you think the enemy should drop the health pack they have when they die, that could solve the low heath issue a bit
[18-11-8 10:56:43] <BlueFox805> that animation was... odd
[18-11-8 10:56:44] <undeaddub> The movement system makes firefights way more interesting
[18-11-8 10:56:47] <BigTiddyBawls> sacLUL sacBROS
[18-11-8 10:56:47] <Lemings> WinterwolfEU No, it was marketed as "showing the lesser known battles of WW2". Don't change facts to your advantage. And yes, in general only those people have this obsession against women
[18-11-8 10:56:51] <Caseysbro> @Connatic would you rather have call of duty gameplay with silly little jetpacks and too futuristic shits
[18-11-8 10:56:54] <FluffyAbsol> Don't make mommy Shannon separate you.
[18-11-8 10:56:56] <Gonz0XP> This girl screams WutFace
[18-11-8 10:57:02] <WinterwolfEU> @ShannonZKiller Im arguing about a point he's just insulting me lmao
[18-11-8 10:57:03] <BlueFox805> lol winterwolf is so mad about viddy games
[18-11-8 10:57:03] <rocketmunkey> @typehazard I think they do?

[18-11-8 10:57:20] <Dragoonseal> unlost117 sacWAVE
[18-11-8 10:57:20] <WinterwolfEU> @burgardorf It was marketed as lesser known facts of WW2 never alternative universe.

[18-11-8 10:57:32] <SpikeWinsTV> No arguing about the game. Take it to reddit
[18-11-8 10:57:34] <larlar219> So the game came out

[18-11-8 10:57:48] <unlost117> hey @Dragoonseal hi
[18-11-8 10:57:49] <rocketmunkey> @Connatic @WinterwolfEU take it to whipsers please, or else move on and enjoy watching the gameplay.
[18-11-8 10:57:49] <SilentVelocityUK> @Dragoonseal thanks mate ^^
[18-11-8 10:57:51] <Caseysbro> oh wow you're actually able to fix your plane and turn now
[18-11-8 10:57:54] <Megareece24> Have the flying mechanics been improved since the beta?
[18-11-8 10:57:58] <Venturchiks> Wait wasnt this place in Post Scriptum as well?
[18-11-8 10:58:01] <Connatic> @Caseysbro what are you talking about? Just saying, every WW2 game doesn't have to be about D-day
[18-11-8 10:58:02] <anayman_k7> cheer10 is the flight control similar to Battlefield 1 or Battlefield 3/4 ?
[18-11-8 10:58:04] <WinterwolfEU> @ryanmakhoul They added a campaign to try to compete with other shooters that pulled off decent campaigns at the time (Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops 1) but never succeeded with a very well received one
[18-11-8 10:58:07] <pykseldot> @Sacriel how's the flying feel? I would imagine not changed much from previous incarnations.
[18-11-8 10:58:07] <TheHermanati> why do people argue just stop and watch the game nobody will gain anything from this
[18-11-8 10:58:08] <Caseysbro> fly through the bridge
[18-11-8 10:58:09] <scarykevinlist> wow the controversy over what timeline or weather its gonna show D-day this game looks sick and I just wanna play it, leave all your arguing at the door and just watch the epic game play
[18-11-8 10:58:10] <Dragoonseal> Ow.
[18-11-8 10:58:13] <BlueFox805> the flak is real

[18-11-8 10:58:15] <rocketmunkey> @typehazard I thought he'd picked up a couple, but maybe they were ammo packs and I'm a blindo

[18-11-8 11:13:24] <originaltimeline> @MajorFoley yea the 4 didn't have an 88 but there is a later model with a longer barrel
[18-11-8 11:13:24] <FluffMuffin94> @sacriel maybe try supply drop? from the plane
[18-11-8 11:13:25] <Cervesas> what about the supply drop thing you did earlier?

[18-11-8 11:13:27] <MajorFoley> @killerkadoffel nah it did say panzer 4 so i am gonna assume the anti infantry models back before they gave em longer barrels
[18-11-8 11:13:27] <Bloodba7h> I like it. I like attrition and ammo not being as prevalent
