@protonjon the pc version of bedrock bowling does exist, and it apparently has a higher framerate than the ps1 version (though no music?)
out trigger

@protonjon speedruns of this game must get all pins, and the fastest speedrun is still just over 9 minutes
out trigger?
i think outtrigger is a racing game
we saved aerosmith before right?

the top middle gif, lol
glover has a good soundtrack @protonjon
:p
memes, the dna of the soul
@protonjon i haven't actually seen glover yet, but i didn't vote for it anyway.
@protonjon because like the kermit legion we like a running gag
we need to nerf glover
there is no mercy only glover
?
infamous 2 was a good choice too
the cat lul
too many eggs?
seconded, @protonjon . not sure what the fascination is.
despite most of the chat screaming the equivalent of "make it stop"

@twilighttheabyssalgamer no. it's a mmorpg.
almost
!impeach
hey jon. linkhaxor doesn't like this game anymore! switch the game up! :(
i know there's a way to hit the ball while on the ground
@protonjon dumb luck
its just a puzzle
@seth_exia it was also better than almost every other game on the list and equal to death's gambit so
@twilighttheabyssalgamer no it’s a jrpg
i don't know why but i remeber smashing the teeth with the ball
"it's fine. except for everything."
wetrix is cool once you know what youre looking at
wait tetris is a puzzle game? kappa
death planes amiright?!
you need to throw the bowling ball at the teeth and the teeth break
majinlul
bowling ball the teeth maybe? fuck if i know

@protonjon i think this is the last time you streamd spider-man 2? but on the ps1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2_7okrcshy
when you think about it, glover is basically katamari without the fun
i'm tempted to vote katamari because it's bowling-esque...
we need more bowling

@protonjon it's a confirmed remaster of game 1
@protonjon there are some games where you play it to see how things get mixed up. katamari is one of those games you play because you know what to expect, like tetris or picross.
and spiderman 2 is coming back being a mod choice
yay katamari :d
@protonjon it is! it's going to be digital and later a physical ver will come out
@protonjon i am so, so sorry
@protonjon please make a bowling emoji.

@unhelpfulnpc if you have the expansion pass you can get the digital version early
@protonjon rex is 15 he can't drink
get of the god dann boat and save pyra

the boat only moves by farting kappa
just drinking on the boat, sounds good
and i kind of want to do that simpson bet that do it for her
this would be like being stranded on the great plateau
i'm on a boat!
thoughts on peachette?
@kuuribro @myohel0 i actually just started watching og dragon ball yesterday. while i didn't find it bad by any means... it was weeeiiird.

@e4iojk she gets a r.o.b pass in my books
did chunky die as one hell of guy?
lul
speaking of katamari, it looks like there's going to be a port of katamari damacy for the switch. namco needs to make a new katamari game now.
civ vi is not a good switch game. that is a micromanaging game made for pc
i am just waiting till all the dlcs for civ 6 to come out to get it
we need fft for switch. and fortune street too
no he isn't
lul
campaign of north africa for switch!
besides, drinking age doesn't mean shit in rpg's
no he can't
15 there's still time for you
no. rex is an idiot.
that's not truw
rex is a nice boy, he wouldn't do that :(
i don't know what the boat is about, besides the muppet party cruise
so how do people turn in egg sounds? i think i turned in one but i don't know if it went through
night jon!
rex himself says he can't drink
i'm psyched for munchkin on switch!
rex is smol
rex is a baby boy
piborip piborip piborip piborip piborip piborip
xd
@protonjon hes a jrpg protag, hes got no parents to tell him no
he drinks milk, like a good boy
@xenodanganmonicals probably a dumb question, but civ 6 will be on pc too, right?
they need to make a dokapon game for switch
@kurribro @myohel0 @protonjon what are your guys thoughts on the fact we're getting so many final fantasy games on switch .....and that we're not getting ff8?
agreed x3
@togeyosh rex is smart, just too optimistic sometimes.
is the cookie after glover done?
protect rex hes too younge
@phsycored rob is apart of nintendo's history. rob helped video games be revived after the game crash
are we talking reks? from final fantasy 12?
@protonjon by that logic, the villains should be allowed to win because they're doing what they want
the fact that they're putting the lord of the rings living card game on switch makes me want asmodee to make a version of legend of the five rings lcg for the switch.
what even are yall talking about?
and 8000 = looking 9
you know, japan

@sdhshadow jon has a dropbox for eggs
@protonjon would you be down for some doa beach volleyball tonight? if the co coms choose it #makewaterslidesgreatagain

always snuggle the nopons!
katamari reroll, anyone?
the nopon in xenox and 2 are assholes
@protonjon just now?
civ 6 on switch looks like it'll run like trash. it'd also be a pain in the ass to play on the switch

did you forget to save
i disagree witj this
did someone own this game before you?
that's before i was born kappa
i found a website for the game
did u not save?
back when chugga was just starting out lping
maybe your clock was wrong?
that is a while ago, like superman part 4
yeah i think your talking about long live the queen
nani
like your gamecube clock?
is the system date correct?
were we at 45%? i'm not sure
@kuuribro kuuribro it's long live the queen
not again.
the superman 64 glitch sound! naroyay
oh hey, it's the 'glitch count' sound from... that lp.
@kuuribro no that was the game that you were thinking of
damn it king
gdi king
not again
long live the queen is still on my backlog.
yup its a hentai
@protonjon your stream archives says december 1, 2013
i think it says "2009" because your xbox 360's clock battery is dead.
not the ducks
@protonjon 360 clock could've been fucked up?
someday i'll play it.
nope. that's not long live the queen.
you're a princess training to be a queen in lltq

but not the king.

@seagulyus yeah. maybe its the lack of sleep but i really should have realized that was totally not what i thought it was
what killed the dinosaurs? the katamari
zonemayo zonemayosquirt
oh dear
@protonjon will you look at my stuff i posted on your twitter?
misread that as a "marketing black hole"
the dinosaurs noooooooo
not the panda balloons
don’t you hate it when you create black holes when you’re playing tennis?
not the planets
a very powerful black hole
consume everything
m6kwbunglepuss m6kwbunglepuss m6kwbunglepuss
such great tennis skills lul
just an fyi, there is a huniepop 2 in the works
...and how did they not get sucked up?
so the black hole is a katamari?
the one you are specifically describing love live the queen though
dammit king, you are a goddamn fuckup
everything is tennis
anything but the tennis net
how does the king keep annihilating everything everything
damn it king, what did you do
that is a god damn crime against tennis courts!!!
tomhole tomhole
so black holes killed the dinosaurs...
fun fact: there can be knock offs of long live the queen
no, not the dinosaurs! they had so much of their lives still ahead of them!
tomhole tomhole tomhole tomhole tomhole tomhole
wow nice
kinda like kirby
gasp
@kuuribro long live the queen was the one that genna and tb played.
it's not like he did it on purpose
oh yeah.
everything is dead
@protonjon he caused the problem
@protonjon reminder the first game was caused because he was drunk off his ass
the king broke the cosmos with a future tennis slam
lltq is the most well known one (and probably the best?)
tomhole
errands for the people of earth
he caused and fixed the problem
@protonjon @kuuribro @myohel0 yeah, the spreadsheet said jon last played it on stream on december 1, 2013. maybe you played it and you forgot to save?
he literally just caused the problem!
katamar
...he did cause the problem though!
well, jon, he created the black hole too
@protonjon i mean, he still caused the black hole in the first place...
uhhhhhh. the r word is a key word in the game tags for it
except he kind of served the black hole up.
daikon dill and cabbage!
he caused the problem, but he also did something to slow the problem down.
im peetty aure he did caused that black hole
@protonjon he caused the problem in the cutscene you just watched
didn't the king cause the black hole?
so hyped for the remake!!
@protonjon though he did kinda create the black hole...
protonthump protonthump protonthump protonthump
cabbage pickle?
he made the black hole in the first place
king's awesome outfit.
the king wasnt always evil?
yeah. that was the basic idea of the second game.
still speaking in records scratches i see
so he caused the black hole, but also put a stopped to it? ... neutral
what?..
um, what
and if you think we can't we'll always find a way
???
it's all his fault again
he spawned a black hole with a tennis serve!
mods???
que?
mod room...?
???
um?
oh god
what the flying shit?! wait a moment?! black hole what the fuck caused?!
oh no

@protonjon i mean, if you go to type in "huniepop" it does show up as a game you can set. you'll just probably get banned if you go live with that as the game.

@gamefan6219 beeeeaaaar
they probably took it out.

@kirbyswarm flintstones bowling and glover
wow rude
joel got unbanned pretty cleanly after misunderstanding was cleared up thankfully
!daily
yes! i was so hoping that was the platinum reward
btw why is this game on xbox 360 and not on playstation
oh thanks
what is the game?
the king is very rude
i kinda feels watching this from the start when the last time i saw this on stream jon beat the game and the made uranus.
out of all of the joel streams i had to miss the one where he got banned
machine washable, dahling, that's a new feature.
the machine washable part is important kappa
sometimes i wonder if people can be unbanned here.
@deb79ful lul
what was the game called again x_x the adult one
or other chats.
i love the koac's vinyl scratch voice
@theultimatejustice who knows?
machine washable if you don't like how it looks before it finishes
oh we're starting with the moon this time? how far we've come
the mooooooon
and to think, in the first game, you had to peel away practically the entire surface of the earth to build a moon
wait...the katamari becomes a moon? so we really haven't 100%'d mario odyssey yet? kappa
roll up the sun
katamari means "clump" or "bundle."
because then it'd make sense.
i mean.... tomlewd
by rolling a katamari!
to be fair, how did he stop the black hole?
so i found in the games category “i temporarily stay at my busty cousins house. which on should i fuck?” xdxdxd
i dunno, how do you make stars off everything you roll up on the earth?
by picking stuff up
it's called newton's lst law of fuck you
nah na na na na nah na naah
do not question the power of the katamari
he could just make a reality
nerds
nnneeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrddddddd!

@kuuribo think of q as discord from my little pony.
dischord from mlp. same character, basicallyu.
q fucks physics and science equivalently to king of all cosmos
atpcap
q is discord from mlp
q is from men in black, what are you people on?
specifically, the next one
eyyy marcy
you caught marcy
so i found in the games category “i temporarily stay at my busty cousins house. which one should i fuck?” xdxdxd
when i hear of q i think of sf3 q
q is the being that introduces them to the borg
royal rainbow pogchamp
q appeared once per season. he's in the first episode.
q is the definition of chaotic neutral
marcy
yeah it was amazing
and the last episode.
q is the best street fighter character
a life without knowing john delancy is not a life i'd want to live
q is a letter of the alphabet
rainbow of royalty
oh yeah that
who watches mlp
it was amazing
q was on tng, ds9, voy and an episode of ent
@gamerman_201 why does that exist
lul
what do you mean ryan
lul
stop calling me sir! (points to whoever gets the reference)
lul
@protonjon just watched the video to make sure i was right. joel was banned for about 2 hours because his game was set to "fuck you", and twitch even admitted in a dm to him that they're surprised that the bots just didn't change the game or something.
the mariachi band!
lol
lul
:p
lul
q was on next generation, deep space 9 and voyager.
lul

that's the exact demographic for that show
i mean
if emile can do it so can you
john delancie

the weirder one was rainbow dash vs starscream
also rainbow dash vs starscream
the leader of the templars in xcom 2 war of the chosen
@protonjon that episode was awesome.
one of my favotie death battles
waht
prince the singer indeed has a penchant for weird things
i actually saw that. i laughed so hard at the ending
and this is one of the reasons why i don't care for deathmatch.
.....ahh...i remember when i was a brony
with mlp?!?!?
what
"i have standards"
its death battle
wait how is he's making the moon when he's sitting on the moon
can we watch that?
that's pretty good!
the only problem is that pinkie pie would never kill anyone :<
that was an episode
congrats you picked the worst horse
thats a thing
fuck i forgot about that episode
to be fair that's a rare good death battle
jon is a brony
moooooooooooooooon
i tend to avoid anything related to my little pony

pinkie pie vs deadpool was one of the season finales. the next death battle is daredevil vs night wing
ahahaha, this... is turning into an interesting conversation.
i mean, i see the mlp death battle. but against deadpool?!?!?!?
... that is the creative moon from lbp.
death* battle
...i... i like it.
@mininessie emile is.,
can i still suggest who killed captain alex for sub movie night?

the sad part, he kind of is?
@protonjon they did pinkie pie vs deadpool, rainbow dash vs starscream, and twilight sparkle vs raven from teen titans.

so if this game after katamari forever
use the glue lukre
both q and discord are played by john de lancie.
rofl
i honestly don't know what's happening.
the brony's are coming!
rookek rookek rookek
oh lord lul
best hors is best hors @protonjon
rainbow dash is best pony
good, out the heathens
lul
q's actor did play discord
man, what a good stream
the target audience of mlp is everyone, specially the adults!
@protonjon at this point, the brony part of my username is just a moniker. i've grown out of the show.
mah balls is best horse
i agree with the person who said my balls is best horse
hey, everyone knows epona is best horse
the connection for me is that i know very little about both series. :p
lucahballs <-- still best horse
shun hem
protonjon: we support stupidity
*leaves fpr 5 minutes*
i'm a fan of mlp but man am i laughing
janeway is best pony, confirmed
failfish
damnit q!
we've started bullshit
i love how we're talking about mlp during a katamari game.
honestly, coco pommel is awesome
star trek... mlp... trump... all connected
why did i come in on a pony rant
logic jumps are the best.
that deadpool vs pinkypie vid ended with both of them raiding screw attack from the internet.
kuuribrony?
no one mention star wars then.
lucahballs lucahballs lucahballs lucahballs
pinkie pie is like the deadpool of mlp (well of the few episodes i've seen)
captain picard is best pony
my vote goes to mr. ed.
and those people forget the earlier episode of death battle wihere rainbow dash fought starscream
well... i missed a lot apparently...
pinkie pie is best pone when written correctly... which unfortunately is very rarely
...what just happened?
my favorite pony is my sonic oc kappa
lucahballs lucahballs lucahballs
because star trek q and discord from mlp are basically the same character. they even have the same character.
mr.ed is the best horse. kappa
dr mccoy is best horse
yeesh, i joined the stream on a train wreck... lul
...i mean she is the worst horse.
uhhhh i stopped paying attention for a second what?
guys, i'm a brony and i know that this is not the place for this.
what the hell did i just miss
no, the best version if doneky is the best horse
my balls is the best horse.
it was all you
mlp discord is voiced by q. also he is basically q
welp imma go do my laundry until you all cool your tits
*same voice actor
hey everybody! word of the day is "clopper"
of*
@protonjon and you picked the wrong generation, obviously! kappa kappa
i do not like horses that much
sometimes you should ignore us
captain sisko is best pony
oh ryan, you're here, too. kappa
from star trek to mlp, brought to you by the letter q @protonjon
@protonjon you can't wear the camera.
@protonjon we aren't angry. we feel the need to justify our existence... and try to get someone else into the fandom
there's nothing wrong with mlp. if you're attacking it, then you're just being a dick.
lucahballs lucahtits
just roll up a few horses; that'll do for wrapping it all up.
q is discords voice actor... he did it again.... q!!!!!!!!!
ooooohhhh, that discord. i thought they meant the chatroom thing.
@fusionfiction63 same, and i agree.
i have no fucking words lul
q voices one of the bad guys
lul
my balls is best pony
blame mods as per usual
ultimate trigger death battle: borg vs cybermen
agreed
@drzock basically because both characters in the battle can break the fourth wall, it ended up as being a big out of video video.
all the red shirts is the best pony
!call
co-comms (myo and ryan https://www.twitch.tv/myohel0 and https://www.twitch.tv/kuuribro ), meet the co-comms. they're a modern protonjon family.
this is illogical, captain
they were talking about star trek not mlp
lul
wrong! captain kirk is best pony!
@vincentssin not yet lul no thomas discussion yet lul
so mlp for next movie night?
q? then lets talk about street fighter too :p
so that's what happened? john de lancie was apparently on that show and that's how we made this transition?
@protonjon this is why love your streams
online vs battle?!
honestly i don't give a shit. if people like the show, fine. if people don't like the show, fine, but don't fucking bash people for what the like or dislike. that ain't cash money, yo.
man balls is best pony!
look, the best horse is clearly secretariat
bob ross is best poby
wait... versus battle?
@protonjon to be fair, william shatner was also in mlp in an episode
@lucahjins do you like mlp
online?
@protonjon the camera is always equipped so you can take pictures in levels.
online vs katamari
i'm used to being ignored when i'm part of chat protonsad protonsad
@protonjon i'm swimming through space
i firmly disagree with the decision to make captain kirk an alicorn.
*pony
i just got in here and i have no idea what's going on
katamari?
!banana
lesleypro_04, i think you slipped up. you wanna be here--http://twitch.tv/masaeanela
then ryan brought up deadpool killing a pony
well more like eldritch demon
@protonjon discord is q in mlp. with the same voice actor, even.
@amephestmako shatner!? when!?
egg school@
egg school!?
protonegg school!
best pony is the mother ****ing blue falcon!
no, he's a draconaqus
discord, im howlin at the moon
i'm captain kirk! i'm captain kirk!
🥚
discord isn't a pony, he's a...well he's choas. he's a lot things at once.
protonegghd
@protonjon he's the god of chaos
how did it jump from mlp to star trek?
no, it's the name of a draconquiss. i think that's how it's spelled.
@protonjon m. bison's horse is the only true best pony
protonegg
oh yes, discord, god of chaos. it's a weird character
driconoquis
well... not "horse" or "pony". a goat... thing
draconaqus
lul lul lul
yes
dragon i think
discord
protonchugga
he is a literal chaos god
@protonjon i believe you meant to say cheese sandwich is best pony, as hes voiced by weird al
@protonjon it's a draconnequis
protonegg protonegghd
nobody knows what the fuck discord is.
chimera
and sleeping in the middle of the summer afternoon
he's a mishmash of shit
its a weird thing
protonegghd school
discord is a lot of things.
protonegg
now for the real question, does emile know about startrek?
it's a.... thing
chaos is happening
@protonjon kind of a khimera.
protonegg
protonegg
discord was a ....beign
a goat dragon
a chimera-sort of creature that has no sense of logic in the mlp world
its a thing with stuff
discord is a dragon goat bird.
dragon-goat chaotic thing
equestrian girls ftw
how fitting
bunny
discord is discord
chat you just fell into this trap 1 minute ago.
protonegg protonegghd protonegg protonegghd protonegg protonegghd protonegg protonegghd

protonegg protonegg protonegg

@protonjon discord is chaos

draconiquis @protonjon
it's a cut and paste creature
sounds edgy
discord i’m howling at the moon
the discords going to all heck
https://clips.twitch.tv/clumsycrazylasagnakapow
so, still q.
discord is a chat site
dadadadadoidodododaaaaaaaa
good. chimeras are good.
discord is also a word that's commonly use
it's an animated character.
he's q's fursona
chaos, a god of destruction?
@kuuribro don't read or respond to this comment
so in other words, he's gloomweaver from sentinels of the multiverse.
discord is an apple
cursess, now i'm being reminded of the fan game "megapony"

lucahballs
balls

daaaaaaadaaaaaaaaaaaa
my balls
and balls and balls and balls
protonfootball
and lucahballs
why not
@protonjon yeah, everyone here plays with balls, right?
because he can
i would've called him a glitch and it would make perfect sense
my balls
lucahballs lucahballs lucahballs lucahballs
his character on mlp is basically just q from star trek.
and no one warned john when he joined the show
all katamaris can be considered chimeras.
if you got em, flaunt em
mismatch of shit sounds about right lol
because he's the king
because he can
he has an ego obvi
aaaabs
why not show your abs?
@protonjon it's the king. king does as he pleases!
because he's the king of all cosmos!
because they're absolutely amazing!
wait.. what???
why aren't you?!
@protonjon doomguy has one too, it's for manly men
he's very proud of himself
amuse itself with its balls.
because king of all cosmos.
i just noticed it!
@protonjon this stream has kinda devolved to something
a b s
why is he not always doing that tbh
my respose to all of this: :kuuribhmm:
orb orbit?
well i mean he was on vacation
damn
my protonfootball s

this is the king of all cosmos, you expect him to just be noble and polite?

you talk about his abs but not his butt chin?
dude was showing off his massive package in the first game
the first katamari was just his crotch though
#showtheking'sbuldgecowards
wishma1mima @ ryan
lul
@protonjon katamari: too hot to handle edition
new secret level in the remake kappa
@protonjon you mean the psvita game
i mean the internet can probably help you find that pretty easy.
wouldn't you show your abs if you had them and were king of the cosmos?? @protonjon
katamari damn-assy
king of all cosmos cosplays as assey mcgee for a game.
an ass like zelda from botw
and the reason is! because he's the king of all cosmos!
the king always shows something for the ladies. case in point: every other game has him with the bulge of all cosmos
i mean, i'd stare at the king's ass
draconnequis. he would have been a logma if lauren faust knew about them.
damn it who gave me that mental image?! i was trying to drink my soda then!!!
ooo, i like this timer so much better.
katamary hardcore edition
@protonjon did you know that weird al yankovic actually showed up in a my little pony episode
this. was. the. best. decision.
why is the text box right over the character?! oo
masae said the same thin
one of the level is in a porn shop
i think 2's beats 1 but
*thing
yeah i agree there
you'd stare at that over the sweet head carpet roll?
we <3 katamari has best ost
oh my god
we love katamari was reeeaaaallly close
yeahh
the damacy theme is just so unthinkably iconic.
well that stuff is subjective
cheese sandwich's song is one of my favorites.
@protonjon and, now that you said that, the one on the switch will have a 9.6soundtrack. :p
katamari on the rocks is one of my favorite songs
i love katamari on the swing.
i was looking up john de lancie and he is in a mlp documentary
i could see that
demacy is the best soundtrack
baby universe!
i can"t make this up
the complete ost yes. any song from newer ones, no.
@protonjon did you play touch my katamari?
glad it's the first game coming to switch
nothing has been more earwormy that katamari on the rocks
german probably has a word for that kappa
i saw huey
is anyone gonna get the switch version of this game?
"very slightly better/worse"
i like the soundtrack more than the one on psp
@thenegativepro okay, let's be fair, video games are a bit more non-specific with regards to target audience. like, nobody's gonna argue mario's meant for kids or anything.
@jacktrevorxd in it?! he fucking produced it!
yuuuuup
@jacktrevorxd yeah...discord is a rather important secondary character in the show
yup
i like to call it toy story 2 syndrome. the later ones are good, but not the level of the original.
is the katamari remaster only for switch?
katamari for smash?
and then fans will complain because they think namco is giving into its hardcore fanbase
@fusionfiction63 yeah, i know but it's an amazing coencidence
they're all so catcchy
goal met
the remaster is for switch and steam
this reminds me of the second vocal song from mario odyssey.
i agree so much
@kuuribro @myohel0 i personally think that beautiful has one of the strongest soundtracks; very close to topping the original. songs like katamari dancing, guru guru gravity, and sayonara rolling star are some of my favorites.
katamari on the swing is a legendary bop
katamari on the rocks is good too
oh, steam? nice!
who originally created katamari?
@protonjon what about touch my katamari's soundtrack? no love for the vita.
i really should check the ost of forever because there was one song i loved but don't know the name
i've only played forever--
excuse me? toy story 3 ts2 ts1! :p fight me. kappa
you know what suffers hard from that syndrome? zero escape.
got a nice spicy katamari egg cooking up
ill be honest? we <3 katamari is better than katamari damacy
they have their own style
but i like three the most for toy story meh opinions whatever their all good in my book
katamari on the swing is probably in my top 10 video game songs.
@protonjon could you give a sample of the song so some of us have an idea of the songs you're talking about
@wootmasterzorsx true, but sonic also has a large audience in games, and other media like comics and tv more than mario, so i guess it's kind of a grey area
@protonjon and then there was that one danganronpa song we all thought was katamari during thrown controllers
there was an idolmaster song in this i think
there is
the older ones feel more upbeat
yeah, its weird but catchy
what was that clipping? protonglitch
royal rainbow
protonegg roopog who gave me this? thank!
the imas song is because one of the stages in the offce.
@thenegativepro that's true, too. i forgot about the comics and everything that exists outside that.
this music feels like a soundtrack you can't appreciate outside of the game similar to the doom 2016
lul
!bingo
https://tinyurl.com/eggbingo
@arizonia1 that happened? what song was it?
is the latest thrown controllers on youtube? i didn't see it
after the first 2 they had to figure out how to make new sounds without just doing remixes. and that's really tough
embrace the weird
that how moon work?
@protonjon have you been seeing masae's katamari lp?
@arizonia1 was it monokuma's theme?
i took me awhile to realize that the king's voice is record scratches
katamari on the swing is my favorite katamari song
gotta love that katamari accapella
wanda wanda
catchy. ^^
yep. weird alright.

@jacktrevorxd excuse me? doom 2016's soundtrack is a banger, i listen to rip & tear and flesh & metal all the time
@kappaburra @acelucario it was at momocon this year, the song's called "let's kill each other"
oh yeah this
que sera sera
ok
yup
wow to me that's the least katamari song
i'm pretty sure i had recognized the dr song and was freaking out that everyone got it wrong

they remixed this one a lot in later games
@starboy35tcoos there is enka style...j-punk, j-pop
i am so hype for twewy final remix
you hear me calling~
i feel like i've heard this used somewhere else...
calling is best song from twewy.
calling is good, but not my favourite becuase i prefer give me all your love
i hope they dont mess up the controls
@enemene16 i've listened to some enka. it's something i can find myself listening to for a bit
@protonjon do you think they would have to change the soundtrack because of copyright with some of the songs?
yeah, i tried to play the ds version. i can't get past the control scheme.
@arizonia1 that is the correct answer, gj
best song right here
@protonjon i know later games included jumping, do you think that the switch version will include that later ability?

@myohel0 didn't demon children song play exclusively in the multiplayer mode?
the katamari forever version of this song is so good
i can't say as i didn't play the ds...but i like the mobile varient
@arizonia1 interesting
holy hornbeam
don't you know, there's nothing worse than stealing games that aren't being sold anymore
oh hey this song!
@protonjon i had twewy back in high school but one day i just never saw the cart again. hoping that the switch version has good controls
protonjon : accepting people when their parents don't
...for now anyway....
i'm just hoping they provide something to make up for it
this sounds so much like the film gold intro music from one piece
bababa
game archiveralry is such ass
i loved the ds combat
honestly i hated twewy, i really didn't like it, and its honestly hard to make me dislike a game thats interesting like twewy
transformation from twewy is also a guilty pleasure song of mine, but people are more split on it.
kunhiro?
first, mario kaizo, now emulators
just because you have the legal right doens't mean it's the right choice.
you can still track down roms. they're not dead yet.
bababa bababababa
..also i blame you for getting me into the series
they have the right doesn't make it fair
vizzed still exists i believe
@protonjon thoughts on katamari on the swing?
the last katamari game we got was "touch my katamari" for the ps vita in 2012...wow
@acelucario transformation is acfan's favorite i think, and i can understand why he likes it
i wanted to get a flashcart to play newer mario ds on actual hardware
#fuckonami
also stuff like the pt effect
so how goes the harassing of the masses?
#fuckonami
which song was this?
devs losing source code? oh you mean like ff8?
and all it does it bump up prices for scalpers
@protonjon they have the legal right to do it, but it also shits in the face of those who try to preserve a bunch of games. as it stands, kingdom hearts 1's original files were lost in a fire, so for the remakes they had to reverse engineer a retail copy.
at least you didn't play symphony of the night on a burned psx disc *whistle*
once a production run ends... that's it, the game's fintie forevre
panzer was a
scorr pilgrim is one of thoser cases
@protonjon name of this song please i love it
as long as every game is legally available, its fine, if a game isn't being sold? what's wrong with pirating it?
i really like touch my katamari, but man it's a battery killer... and i'd much prefer having an actual katamari game.
*finite forever
scott*
!bingo
https://tinyurl.com/eggbingo
original kingdom hearts as well
@katarani is that why ff8 isn't coming to switch?!
there are way too many rom sites for me to care what they shut down
@3ternals0ul really that happened?
mother 3
like the kryptonite fog? kappa
@ryukagechroma it's the most plausible theory
og kh is not really needed though @adambomb2002
rule of rose was another game hard to find in a good complete edition
i think ffx's source code was also lost, so the hd version was done from scratch
yep
not only that, but @protonjon what about games with fan translations. people have played the games of the fire emblem series because fans translated the games that nintendo didn't.
for spyro reignited they couldn't use the source code so they instead made a program that mapped out the levels in the original games and ported those proportions and enemy behaviours into the remake.
as a fe fan especially tellius getting some games suck
digital games are a double edged sword. the good: games are more available. the bad, you need some sort of drm to play them and that drm could up and stop service and you will not be able to back up anymore.
@protonjon thoughts on the nintendo switch online?
which is why i'm glad capcom keeps porting their shit cause i don't want to lose any of their titles if we can help it
@shadow_war yeah, i think it was a fire. either way, they did lose the source code for kh1 and had to remake it.
all those weird pre smartphone games are going to be lost soon
ps1 games wouldn't make good source code for remakes, anyway.
and to clearify, steam = drm.
source code loss doesn't really affect making games availability, just makes remakes harder
seemsgood
the thing with media is if stuff didn't get lost or destroyed so we aren't completely oversaturated in outdated crap
nooo angel flavor's gifts
mmmmm this is the most calming one
oh, that's how it is jon? just gonna skip right past que sera sera?
ff8 might also be an example of lost source code
i believe ffix was lost for a while too.
there are also those games that never get released in america and canada
hey everybody!
well the nes and snes classic are just emulators basically are they not? @protonjon
they can't even keep track of their own shit, why do they complain about people who do?
i should just look up the osts for katamari later
@protonjon i don't know if you know what langrisser is but i am excited that its being remade for switch.
!uptime
protonjon has been streaming for: 1 hour 59 minutes 26 seconds
i think starcraft also lost its code
yeah, we love was supposed to be it
i think the original ffix was also lost, which is why they took so long to get it remade.
@protonjon blizzard lost the source code for starcraft but thanks to a random fan who got a cd of it on ebay they were able to use it for the remake.
if the second game was the first then you'd be saying the same
i think you are looking for the song that's called cherry blossom something
toys for bob had to remake spyro from the ground up for the reignited trilogy
the great thing about this is that you can't even tell that we're listening to a different soundtrack
@protonjon also, katamari is coming out on pc too. that means: mods.
i also feel it's necessary to mention that nintendo is super against emulation, but they apparently sold people roms of super mario bros. 1
@protonjon original composer returning or not is one of my big fears of streets of rage 4. i hope they either get direction from the original composer or just get them back
in to sex?
its been 2 seconds kappa
2 sexq
oooh. takoyaki :p
@miatog42 they actually didn't need the source code. it was mostly done when they got the source code
i feel like some game sound tracks need slower songs to blend with the faster songs, so not all sound the same
@kasumi89 nah, it's noticeable with no game sound effects.

strangely this music is very appropriate to how my day went
i can only hear larry's high silk hat.

what about your employees being happy instead of having to meet ridiculous deadlines?! ><
wow
oh no..
wow
does it play that song in the ps4 one
was this early enough for yuri to voice or was it someone else?
and that, ladies and gentlemen, is why you probably shouldn't mix game actors with movie actors.
so, i learned this the other day that the lizard was originally planned to be the villain for the third film but the studio pushed venom
ｗｏｗｍｒａｚｉｚ
is this romans voice actor?
same here
"maybe i'll give you a bonus for doing something nigh-impossible"
that comes a little later

because i don't
i think you can get to that point pretty easily @protonjon
dr. connor's all the time class
mmaaaannnn i did not miss toby maguire one bit
hey man i take a night class too.
he failed the daytime one cause he missed it too many times
how is the swinging in this game compared to the new game?
dr. connors' class? can't we transfer to ms. frizzle's class?
#dr.connor'snoghtclass
jk simmons has played j jonah jameson parodies in three seperate simpsons episodes, two of which are in the same season.
@protonjon i'll be honest, as someone who delivers food for a living that was weirdly cathartic, partly because i've never seen the pizza minigame before
@trevorblade how dare you be here and support jon's stream. kappa
dr. connors is such an old lizard, isn't he? kappa
oh no dr. connor's science class.
"hold on, prof, i need to deliver this pizza"
what, you never had a class at 8 pm in college? unless he's in high school.
4 am in the morning. to quote strong mad, that's redundant!
but @protonjon do you have to worry about paying rent in this game?
you hold the l button to go faster
when pizza's on a bagel you can go to dr. connor's class any time
"for every gem of a game"
@dropsofmoonlight i had a college class at 9pm once
the speed upgrades for the swinging are heavenly too
*semester
ps2 spiderman 1 tutorial was great for snark also, i loved it
well it make sense cuz of night schooling
"the green goblin just stole a bomb to hold the city ransom, and the prom is starting!"
seeing this game only makes me want to play the new spider-man game which i don't have.
is there fall damage?
the heck is gravity, anyway?
great camera
j. jonah jameson is right about spider-man! my son lost his balloon and spider-man just stood there and watched as it floated away! kappa
@dropsofmoonlight had classes at 7:30 once. i skipped the majority of the classes
why is he still wearing glasses?
ryan, talking about how good the game is is making the game worse for jon! kappa
aannnnnnnnnd dumped
mj? michael jackson? pogchamp
@protonjon dont forget "oh no, my balloon!"

can we put the new one on cookie? kappa
and then memes will win
go play the new spiderman!!!!
this was a bad idea
@protonjon why would any mod put a good game on cookie?
i finished the platinum of spiderman about an hour ago
hey d:
yes, playing this game was a bad idea
what about web of shadows?
hey
my choice for the cookie is the new spiderman for ps
yeah, myo, it's not like this is jon's stream or anything! kappa
hey
my god. this voice acting
i feel like the ps4 graphics should be better...
ahhh~
ps4*
i just got the platinum in spider-man the other day, easily the best spider-man game so far
kicking people in the mouth from the sky
bang
play an even older spiderman!
i knew you'd show up sooner or later.
the new spider-man looks great
i want pictures of new spiderman game
let's get him!
why would we let you play good games jon?

@protonjon "you got nice moves." "and *you* got nice boobs."
wait
rookiss kiss the cat!
lul
good job tobey
oh look black cat
@protonjon is that catwoman?
waaaaaait
scene transition with no music change, nice
lul
no, stop. come back
her hair is weird
lul
lul
rookiss ... oh right, bahroo changed the emote
cheer1 cheer1
oh no.... dr. black cat's class....
what the fuck?! was that her outfit? eww
why wouldn't the music stop!
what a cut! lul
" i dont wanna die" "my god"
was black cat in the movies?
oh a trailing mission. with a literal trail
what a hard cut
she went there.
mysterious white-haired lady. follow her, pete!
wait stop
black cat, that one character who's in every spider-man game despite not actually being that important of a spider-man character
holy shit,zip up your jumpsuit,lady. you're about 3 seconds away from raising the rating of this game!
hello, black cat...
oh hi felicia
yeah, black cat's costume is always like that
i know catwoman's costume is fully closed
that was some serious cleavage in her costume
x-men legends preview
felicia let's her boobs hang out
try b button?
lul
how do i shoot web?
i only know the gamecube controls
how do you shot web?
x button @protonjon
look i fucking loved x-men legends
how do i shot web?\
@arcadepark you have not seen catwoman in a while then.
exbax
good thing she waited
i think running up walls is an upgrade in this game
@protonjon how do i shot web?
wait, what happend to catwoman?
flat iron
wow spiderman ps4 looks good
how do i play the game
nice of them to give you a comet trail
wow, black cat can jump like superman was a kangaroo.
how do i shot web?
you don't know when to quit!
can someone turn off her halo? it's disturbing the traffic.
someone's probably already made that joke
yeah, black cat sure is good at teaching you how to swing, if you know what i mean.
you can but you need to jump
@protonjon is it the run button maybe?
thats an upgrade i think.
lt is your turbo button. try that and b.
@protonjon you can use the button for sprint to give yourself a boost of speed while swinging!
hulk smashes
i mean, this guy hasn't been spider-man for 8 years kappa
you don't ned much momentum, you can run up them if you're moving in that direction
that works
he doesn't run up walls
in the ultimate spider-man, you can run up
you can eventually run up with enough upgrades
he run walls up the air
@protonjon smash, smash smash
i ran up walls plent of times
there's no option to turn on inverted x-axis in the new one and it bothers me
my favorite spiderman moment is the moment black cat kisses spiderman through his mask, finds out he's a teenage adult, then vomits on his chest
fair point
you can run straight up
so basically the parkour system from sonic lost world?
fuck gravity, i'm spiderman
you turn off the power.... that’s how you climb walls kappa
so no one remembers spiderman web of shadows?
i just got back, how many games has he done since glover?
gwen stacy.
@protonjon i believe running is an upgrade in this game
constantly
@protonjon crash, crash crash (the game)
you can run up walls in some of the later games i know
pfff, screw gravity
"it's time to tryyyyy defyyyyyying graaaaaaaaavity!" :d
uhhhh ... i mean, gwen stacy might want to have a gripe against gravity in spiderman
spiderman: isaac newton edition
and then spiderman ps4 patched it out
lul
it was introduced in dr. connors clas
lul
gravity was introduced when... oh, that might be spoilers.
black cat is felicia hardy
gravity is a bitch
...was black cat in spider man 2?
@ethanikomargashi yeah, in that game running up the walls is basically automatic if i remember
um, excuse me? gravity was invented by valve for half life 2. they made an entire gun around the idea.
going from yuri lowenthal spiderman to this is....oof
the game was developed by apple lead designer issac newton kappa
black cat is the not catwoman.
do you have to actually catch her???
maybe she got lost. :p
its a combination of running with l, and jumping with a and x @protonjon
well i mean, it's not like you can shoot webs out of your feet, that'd be silly
so when is dr. connors lecturing at captainfalconschool.com
@xilehnoc not in the movie, only in this game
my 11:30 cancelled.
i can relate.
gwen stacy dieing is like 50 years old, i think it's past the spoiler window
dont u have somewhere to be yes doctor connors class.. @protonjon lul
"longer than is comfortable." kappa
my 11:30 was... do. connor's class
there's a ton of extra villains in the game like shocker and mysterio
@xilehnoc the movie? no. these movie-to-game adaptations tended to add more villians.
is this spider man hd?
i don't remember this character in the movie...
#onlythenaughtyones
remember the time spiderman and doc oc traded mineds
spoilers
hey bruce!
spidey store!
aha
okay,seriously,her tits would have popped out like,three times there.

yep fmmmm dmm mmmmmmmmm i peter does is mumble
@protonjon petition to make pizza time the cookie music for tonight.
and then spiderman became an asshole?
i remember the first movie game had some scenes from the movie, but was mostly its own story and the villain was the vulture.
yes that was so good
man now i want to play this
superior spider-man people
then again, rino was in the pc version and wasn't in the movie either xd
do we get to listen to jameson talk about spider-man being a menace now? kappa
oh shit, that really is him.
didnt he make a sandwich?
alright bruce campbell, back to fighting ski bum matt.
"well done. you're swinging..."

immediate "you're fired"
how often does peter get fired in this game?
you're fired, now get me more pictures
that was a creepy chuckle!
j.j. covered wars
@arcadepark nope, you're right. he wants spider-man to get pictures of peter parker because he doesn't ever get pictures of spider-man, so he wants to see why peter can't ever get the pictures.
wait how does employment work?

oh wow
o_o
oh
*waiting to desktop app to stop being trash* oh, we're back.
oh the duke
it counts only if you actually do the job for him
that existed?
the duke
that brings me back
yup
there were no bumpers
what are those!?!?
what
oh ok..
jeez, i remember those. that was always a dumb decision.
ew
more like mini duke
eeeuuugh
also, there was the duke.
wow, i forgot about that design
i actually kind of miss those buttons
this controller existed.
did we already go to cookie? or is this a break?
yup. weird.
@ozzyman314 that"s who i was trying to remember. alex jones.
show off that massive original controller lul
eeeew
ohhh i see
wutface
thats the duke!
ugggh
best trigger ever!
so was it trying to be the genesis?
@protonjon get jameson some jammies. he'll totally be pleased and re-hire you kappa
the duke lul
the duke
the duke @protonjon
oh wow that's. weird.
the duke was great for my big hands
people don't remember those? i only ever saw those
gee
it was a chunky boy
hail the duke!
i remember the duke!
i love the duke <3
that's horrible!!
is that a d pad?!?!
it was huge
wtf was that
t h i c c
the original is large enough to kill a small pet if you drop it
das one chunky boi
the fat man
i love the duke
that's a dpad?!
early xbox controllers are so bad.
god i hated that controller
ouch, that hurts my soul
<.<
yup. the duke had the arcade style 6 button layout. it's a better layout for fighting games... and that's about it.
what?
thicc
people are stupide
why?
nostalgia's a hell of a drug
>.>
?
d-pad, i think the whole thing is weird
...what!?
i'll stick with my 360 controller tyvm.
huge
i hate the general look of the xbox controllers. hate asemetrical controllers
sup.
i have baby hands
legit worse than the n64 controller.
and people wonder why i liked the n64 controler...
big
its at least better than the n64 controller?
so this was a controller meant for me
xbox huge
i have a friend who prefers it to the smaller ones
but from what i heard, the xbox one compatible duke controller sucks and is cheap-feeling @protonjon
why make the center logo so massive?
i could not use that controller because i have small hands
big meaty claws
come again??
you know what they say about a guy with huge hands.... he has a huge xbox controller.
i have huge hands. i liked the original one.
fighting game?
wow
ari....it is done
i have huge hands and i still hate that controller. the revised one is way nicer
@protonjon where did the name "the duke" come from?
@protonjon jonah is played by charles klausmeyer, he voices raphael in soul calibur, and "citizens of metropolis" in the superman returns game.
relic of the time, and relic of its dreamcast heritage.
riiiight mvc2
@protonjon remember jake and snakes?
that music
spooder-man, spooder-man.
what system are these for, can't tell with that logo
that movie music
they call it the duke because it's real big.
yep the duke you could beat someone with it lol
oh no, doctor connor's class
also, i loved having the start and back buttons under my left thumb. also, i disagree about the d-pad. i think the x1's d-pad is fantastic.
yeah, the va for jjj is not the same as frank west, sorry @protonjon
lul
sounds wrong.. lul
hail to the king baby kappa

intense music
if i remember the original movie, there's a scene that had dr. oc
@protonjon a lot of people call it the dog controller.
also, spider-man never killed a man. play the new game to get that one. kappa
what is this music
i love that bit @myohel0 lol
to be fair, that was a beautiful view. :p
if i remember the original movie, there's a scene that had dr. octopus robbing a bank i press enter prematurely.
"spiderman eats pavement!"
hey @myohel0 ... the dog face https://i.redd.it/1lczp5ndhm2z.jpg
@damonkatumaru didn't spiderman kill the green goblin in the first movie?
!eggsound
here's the default egg sound if you would like to make your own: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nus5svbltykguaq/egg.wav?dl=0
it tried too hard to be a sam raimi film game.
ugh. good thing i'm not spiderman.
@damonkatumaru that joke doesn't work for him.
@arcadepark yes
:d
?????
oh
okay, robbie totally knows that pete is spider-man
i'm stupid
at least you can actually see the city unlike superman 64
yay walking on air!
@damonkatumaru nuh uh in the new game every bad guy comes with a preloaded web net to grab hium to the nearest wall :p
@protonjon i'm surprise that j jonah jameson never questions peter how he got the pictures of spiderman
i forgot how much i liked photography
this music is way too good.
man i feel like spiderman
but it was one of the best open-world games of it's time too. :3
lol
what?
it's kinda nice how the map even shows you where the marker's height is relative to spider-man @protonjon
oh no question that robbie knows that you're spider-man
isabelle for smash
i hope j.j. knows these shots are something that only spider man can take, but he expects peter to take these pictures casually @protonjon
@protonjon one of my favourite things to do in this game was grab an enemy and bring as high up as i can, then pile drive them to the ground.
not quite gta3 or san andreas.
now we can smash isabelle
that was 2 days ago
internet works fast kappa
plop
lul
@arcadepark no, spider-man dodged the goblins glider attack and the blades of it hit him
i thought the object was to get spiderman in the photos??
but still...
oof
lul
free fallin!
@protonjon how was playing "sneak king" with the duke?
ow
i think it existed long beforehands
free fa-splat
@myohel0 @kuuribro the fucking reaction to isabelle has been insane, so much art and memes in 2 days
everyone smash isabelle
right, the tokens in this game.
coro coro just came out and they are saying smash ultimate has 108 levels so far
well, stabbed

@protonjon i forgot treyarch made these spiderman games. it does show how time has changed, since treyarch went on to make 3 extremely well received call of duty games
i believe there's about 3-4 different types.
crack your head, spill your blood. paint the walls a shade of red.
hey, spider-man! do a flip!
it really makes you feel like spiderman
i actually am related to tom petty (my last name is actually petty)
look out, look out for that floor spider-man.
skyscraper, hideout, buoy, and one other.
@protonjon apparently the oddly specific ethyl chloride anti-spider pesticide is spidey's kryptonite. minikis

favorite nickleback song?
@myohel0, @kuuribo, @protonjon and chat favorite spider-man villain?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypgy2d2xb1a
no we don"t
he did send it in the discord.
you didn't look at mine
same
and now i can sleep. good day and night folks!
@kuuribro @myohel0 so how are you doing now? x3
everyone is supposed to hate nickelback
really?!
did you know that a member of the q species was in an episode of star trek tos?
doesn't everyone hate nickleback?
wow.
@protonjon i thought anyone who cared about music was supposed to, by default, hate nickelback. :p
error occurred!
so you guys dont use nickels in canada?
big wheel
you mean alfred molena?
...this drawing....is looking way too cute..
dr. octagonapus? kappa
exactly, afro.
@afro_rat i dont
i enjoy some nickleback. my music taste is also awful so, shrug
definitely venom
i haven't laughed that hard in too long. thank you xd
ive seen nickleback in concert
i actually kinda like nickelback. don't hate me.
do you know superior spider man?
my favorite spiderman villain is dr connor's class.
https://clips.twitch.tv/gleamingplumpkaleanele
spider-man is the only superhero i like
superior spider man?
how long is the intermission?
i actually like nickleback
doctor octogonapus blaaaaaaaaa
i think venom was always my favorite spider man boy
dr. octa-motherfucking-gonapus! bllllargh!
micheal keaton was fantastic.
what games are you guys looking forward to?
i like them.
i dont hate nickelback
can you look at this photograph? does it make you laugh?
no, nickelback is not a bad band.
i've had that mashup saved on my computer for months but never got around to uploading it. i thought the stream would be a good debut!
what's wrong with nickelback? is he bad?
https://clips.twitch.tv/outstandingboredcrabpjsugar
the one where doc oct and peter parker switch minds?
@protonjon "it's hard to get inside the existential paradox of kroeger's life on tour: every day, he gives interviews to journalists and radio djs who directly ask him why no one likes his band. every night, he plays music to thousands of enraptured superfans, many of whom love him with a ferocity that's probably unhealthy."
nickelback is so ok
that statement has many ways to be proven wrong.
it's that... their first album sucked. and it was weird
dont forget mgk died yesterday.
i just don't give a crap about nickelback because i don't like the genre they do
is your sister human?
i neither like or dislike them leaning a bit more towards like
this song must be surprised to the far reaches of the internet.
somebody and how you remind me
the tune was the same for three songs.
*someday and how you remind me
yup i remember that
i only know the memes, tbh :p
at least they didn't dump waste in the river like red hot chilli peppers
they shit on them because the songs are the same and because they were sung all the time!
@protonjon remember the time when peter parker and doc oct switch minds?
and also lead singer is kinda a douche
nickelback is just really average
rock star and animal are pretty okay
so it's the same as modern country music?
look at this graph!
lookit this graaaaaaph
sooomeday sooomehow gonna make it alright
look at this faaagot
i still love hero from knickleback it was a song for the 1st spiderman movie
i like some theory songs
*sings* this is how, you remind me of what i really am...
lol "objectively bad", that's a nonsense phrase
oooooo
@protonjon and then peter died with doc oct's body?
@etrianrune :(
look at this pink giraffe
3010?
hello jon!
i like dx from theory
look at this graph!
and thene doc oct became the new spiderman?
theory is signed to chad kroeger's label
@etrianrune no
3010?
did you know that a member of the q species was in star trek tos?
and we all just wanna be a big rock star~
favorite batman villain?
oh, i think i know that one.
good times
california gurls and tik tok? yeah similar sounding songs
look at this baaaadge kappa
@protonjon where's the egg carton?
i went to a nickback concert for three day's grace. it was a scene phase
oh..... i think that was done with the 4 cords too.
@meganerd20 nah it's true
!egg
@protonjon look up 4 chords song
lul
lul
popular bands that get a lot of radio play always get shit
4 chords of pop
lul
oh no

nickelback became the hipster punching bag after they became popular. but in this case, they actually deserve some hate.

@xilehnoc did you find out who stole that tree?
https://store.steampowered.com/app/790820/valkyria_chronicles_4/ release date: sept 25th. $60 usd. denuvo warning, for those that care about it.
well shit, good job jon *goes to get my copy of valkyria revolution*
it's just damage taken from enemies @ultaki
what happens if you set all control options to the same thing?
@tenmar actually, i think 3 is the only one that never saw an international release
also, only vc game we never got out of five is just vc3.
ugh, only 90fps? that's barely even watchable kappa
but... the flowers...
@disgaea_demon_overlord fire emblem's a close comparison, yeah.
we got every other one.
sir reporting in sir
i love how the mouth look like fish
gotcha
hey keith silverstein
@xilehnoc also today is the one-year anniversary of a certain game that was featured on grumps.
i do love the esthetic of this game. i like the old photo/drawing effect.
he's not in one piece. different series. :p

hey its not-coredila
"i'm sorry, i was too busy crying over the flowers."

@just_some_dude12 the tree trimmers
hellllllo nurse <3 <3 <3 <3
welp, i guess not-cordelia will be my favorite character
you are not cordelia.

she looks deadon like cordelia except in personality
she even has a fe unit name... except she has a last name.
what a bitch
also not minerva
@camille_skyloft !
lytfilth
minerva is the name of a fe unit too @protonjon :p
that does indeed look like a fire emblem character. get in her pants!
hey, it's brave lance fodder kappa
cordelia taking up the name of another fe character
she's missing the wing clips
tsundere much?
hello alexis tipton
she even has the name of a fire emblem unit
@disgaea_demon_overlord alrigth scratch that. awakening is *not* a good comparison
@ceiebison_m oh god they started that in september? i thought it was december
sorry lt. headupherownass
first morag and now cordelia. man so many stolen characters
welp
it's like cordellia and severa did a fusion dance.
she looks kinda like the fe minerva.
protongood
@xilehnoc i knew it!!!
wasn't minerva a fe unit in sacred stones?
she bares a slight resemblance to pyra, mostly becaseu of the big knockers
protongood
road roller?
protongood
it's not-cordielia with her daughter's personnality.
wait a second her va sounds like lucina's va
minervykins :)
i wont sugar coat it we are fucked
welp, i wanted to not have any spoilers. but jon is playing vc, gotta watch. <3
@xilehnoc no i mean the game itself is a year old
cliche start? check.
okay, someone needs to give her a lesson in humility.
so we're the french?
i almost just filled the chat with zeros because my phone was resting on the 0 key on the numberpad glad i caught that
@kuuribro the only one tbs game i've played was mario and rabbids.
so it's not our territory. good to know.
i'm waiting for cheche to call out, "snack time minerva!"
shadow dragon, actually.
minerva is an fe unit, but she looks more like cordelia
@vanudude79 shadow dragon/mystery

@ceiebison_m ohhhh

and so are the flowers.
@vanudude79 shadow dragon had a main character named minerva
@vanudude79 mystery of the emblem with marth
minerva was in fe 1 3 11 and 12
if this draws out much longer, we'll never be able to save our flowers!
she is the name of a wyvarn in awakening
very bad kappa
tha's just europe but with an a at the end!
y'know, not europe, kappa
minerva was fe1, fe3, and their remakes.
@ceiebison_m yeah i'm still not okay after that
das bad.
the empire would not replant the flowers.
xfd
that's good!
and thus, i would be ded.
man this is just fire emblem with modern machinery isnt it?
das bad
!subperk
that bad's
kind of @taganplaysstuff
that's rad
but is it protongood?
that's juat spanish for eurpoe!
das bad!
the toppings contain potassium benzoate
i mean, she even has the same eyes as cordy
protongood
they got off their brass and did something.
lul
ooh, that's bad.
hmmmmmmmmmmmm
thats bad
@protonjon after all communism is just a red herring
that's good.
xd
simpsons, much?
how plot convenient.
yeah.....
that's bad.
it's not fire emblem. it has similarities, but the gameplay is significantly different
that's bad.
that's gonna be bad
that's not gonna work...
@sparkin65 named after sd minerva in development. :p
countermeasures! protonraid protonraid protonraid
the frogurt is also cursed
lul
thats rad
thats bad
that's good!
so we murder everyone?
bad idea
sounds too good to be true.
oh that's right! i haven't played shadow dragon in forever
the worst idea
this early in the game? that's bad
it comes with a free frogurt!
they gonna die
........
yeah! save europa, please. :p camille and i will be grateful. ;)
that's suicice...
that always goes so well
can i go now?
@protonjon fascism in a sega game?
hi hon what did i miss?
bad idea
"put all our force into one strike." that's bad
so, the crotch?
so shoot a train at them?
the nuts
@kuuribro just like disgaea.
it's a trap!
alexis tipton!!!
that didn't work for the ijn...
that's good, i like it
one. fell. swoop.
so this is in europe
that's a bad plan...
@xilehnoc siivagunner did a rip of one of their songs today, mashed it up with happy birthday
bad plan
so who here like fire emblem apparently
him*
twitch does not like me tonight.
what could possibly go wrong?
this seems like not the best plan.
literally everyone will die
wonder if this guy with the "generic npc" design is gonna live or not
bye europa
@protonjon um, that smells like a trap.
minerva's va is totally lucina's va from fe:warriors/awakening
this is gonna fail.
@counterpointclover yeah ! save us @protonjon ! save the europeans !
oh good
all of them kappa
...and if it fails?
i could,
only one crucial enemy base?
miserably.
protondeath
to be fair, they'll lose anyway if they don't try, isn't that what they're going on about?
@ceiebison_m wryyyyyyyyyyy
totally a plan designed by a double agent.
that officer guy looks lkinda like adam sandler with a beard
cleaveland!
we're the meatshield.
this is going to end horribly
why not more?

sup gallia. i see you there

protonjon has been streaming for: 33 minutes 45 seconds

hi, boobies.
nato heh
@protonjon they know who is most likely to play this game
cathrine narrator?
i mean, it's sega, right?
gallia? land of the furries?
someone needs to get lucah to play this game. i have a feeling she'd enjoy it.
a crystal?!
subtle
one country is named sneek
is this final fantasy?!
yeah, i think i hear alexis tipton there as minerva
and now it's time for exposition!
who is this voice? it's so familiar
omg it really is communism
wait ! it's sojiro from persona 5 !
@protonjon so this is literally world war ii?
riveting enemy organization name
so this is occidental europe vs eastern europe
it's warhammer classic!!! protonchugga
ass, boobs, and tanks! this game's got everything!
so literally wwii
knights and tanks? lul
to warrrrrrrr
thsts alot of lancers
dear chat, i just want you all to know that i play this for the plot.
yes. it's wwii
#totallynoteurope
assen
this is basically ww2
hey, there's gallia
sojiro!
oh man german is invaiding france
@shiren45 jamieson price, yes
assen.
complete with racist overtones
het look gallia
they have lance sapped cannons!?
more like the cold war, honestly
ww2 but without america
rip collogne
except with actual war
this sounds like the lost in disgaea 5.
oh wow, we're feddies this game?
oh hey, they have actual french names in that map !
@kuuribro oh boy, my favorite
shaped*
its literally wwii
that's part of why i love this series so much. <3
love that cutscene power, bullets are useless unless you're a protagonist.
i love the completely non-german but german-sounding names. :d
ah, good.
@protonjon okay, if they could lip-sync this game, what kept them from doing the same with the ps3/xbla rereleases of sa1 & sa2? man, sega's inconsistent...
wait, so this based off of actual history?
protongood
#eastentheater
so we are the allies invading russia in ww ii
oh enemy has bigger guns, just use some spears and heavy armor
@13engtay no
why does that woman look and behave like erza scarlet?!
oh no that wall
northern cross is twinkling and watching- wait, wrong cross.
@xilehnoc the first valkyria chronicles was about as serious as games have ever got about it. it didn't pull punches
you can say it's alternate universe
exposition!
ah yes the mother landdddd
basically just like wow battle for azeroth, except wow has azerite and the alliance and horde fighting over it, and the azerite is basically like mako energy from ff7 and neither faction are purely good or evil (except sylvanas, she's evil af) minikis
jepsonsalute yes sir
it is wwii where is the version of british
@protonjon i just joined in so maybe you've been asked this already, but have you played any games in this series before?
protonraid
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
for the motherlaaaaaaaaaaaaand
@counterpointclover do you mean to tell me that scheissenkopfern is not a real name kappa
dear @13engtay think of this as a fantasy based ww2 game.
we will rise against the clans!
huh, none of the english va's are credited on imdb yet
so this is basically wwii?
protonraid
"we will find you some faces!"
@kuuribro oof
this isn't ww ii its more like if the cold war actually happened

@mariokart2014 au world war ii, to be honest.
you do it pre-battle, i think
@protonjon it's hard to find. you can't get to it yet
@supercapturedevice who's diddly?
dear @protonjon you don't have access to it yet.
@thegtf thanks.
you don't get the equipment menu before the next chatper

you have to finish this chapter
@protonjon it'll be in base camp, once you find that
ah man i love this anime take on wwii
no, this is from the federation perspective. some of the characters in the squad you're playing as are gallians
don’t equip acessories to your tank pilot, he does not benifit from them in the tank.
we have not arrived at the barracks
i do enjoy the ost of this game
that rocket launcher
i just realized red head is named the greek goddess of war and intelligence
put the pen on the paper
that's a big ass rpg!!!
@thegtf i figured as much because “gallian” forces, but i wasn’t sure lul
@sdhshadow it is interesting.
holy shit that is a huge rpg
oh hey mario day
rhyme
take stalingrad! kappa just not in winter kappa
that's a big ass rpg!
that is a big gun
holy crap,did you see that launcher!?
he just rhymed.
the ferocity of the french taunting took king arthur completely by surprise.
this art style reminds me of xenoblade 2
oh yeah this looks super dope
@thetaser roman, actually. the greek one is athena.
okay for a second i though he said farts grad
big freakin' gun
is this for xbox one?
that much more the just 2 guys, 2 girls and a dog

woo! bad ideas!
never fight a land war in russia
but it's anime, so it'll work
weeeeellppp
bad ideas are the best ideas!
there are no bad ideas in war!

this is such a bad idea(
@protonjon it's not bad, it's protongood
why not use a boat?
it's not going to! turn back!
lul
lul ww1 plan on steroids
have you considered going across the sea instead?
super bad idea
oooooooooooh that's a bad idea
everyone is stupid
bad idea week
i'm sorry, did he just pronounce "schwartzgard" as "fartsgard"?
he's dead
this would not work in a normal war
full force
winter is coming kappa
that is so a bad idea.
he's dead.
this is the worst plan ever
where's vyse when you need him
busting out the body bags...
famous last words
operation enduring clusterfuck
is that kyle mccarley as claude?
this is the worst idea
go through the ocean
woohoo! let's get this land war in not-asia started!
ultra bad idea
it's barbarossa all over again!
welp. goodbye comrades
everyone knows not to invade russia
he's so dead.
... attacking russia in winter. good plan. gooood plan
swartzgrad? is that a grad school? kappa
i'm absolutely sure your supply lines will never be disrupted!
pogchamp2 i some how made it to a proton jon steam pogchamp3
they're all dead
it was good knowing you
this will end baldy. i don't think going that far in is easy.
but it's such a terrible idea!
"hey lets just take on the entire enemy army"
@protonjon i'm busting out the body bags...
yeah its the warhammer classic empire
@protonjon it's time for another good idea, bad idea.
so this guy's not living to see the next cutscene
for the game to start with this, i see it going perfectly
... *russian winter is a **biiiitch***
reminder that the first game is about a literal suicide squad
invading russia is literally the dumbest idea on the planet
raz, you dick!
so very very dead
don't you people know military tactics at all
crazy ideas are the least expected ideas
raz is a dick.
give him back the camera

@protonjon that guy with the camera sounds like yugi moto
it's always a great idea to invade russia with unprepared troops and heavy tank through the muddy lan
the empire probably has weak control of those areas that they're skipping past and local militias will take care of the rest
i already love mai

france got invaded?! that never happens!
now we start vc 1
invaded the beast tribe? oh wait wrong game kappa

@andoru90 you know someone's gonna donate as bagel and say "dad, i wanna go to war too!!!" :p
and there’s my answer. lul
first game references!
yes! that's erica mendez, because sounds like gon
dear chat, so this game takes place a bit before the original vc. so it happens at the same time.
now if only gallia had caineghis and his troops...
maximilian dood?!
@myohel0 i mean i sat through that, so i could weather an rpg tutorial stream too
dayum it
pegasus kappa
this is literally a side story to vc1. :d
we all know this is basicly fire emblem with guns "we cant do this, were to weak of a force!" and then they do it anyway becuse they somehow have like powers to overcome odds or...something
oh really, references to vc1?
why don"t they move and fight instead of complain!!!!!!!
oh look, this army actually feels like telling their troops critical information, unlike a certain commander purple hair

@camille_skyloft they've invaded fake france! prepare for war!
this is the worst idea
no shit raz
ah yess, the battle where general incompitant used chemical warfare cheats... *and still couldn't win* because one imp had anti nerve toxin on hand.
oooh, this is a prequel!
maximilian pegasus?
@tenmar oh god i hope he is
@tenmar all of the valchron games take place approximately at the same time
@mariokart2014 political debates in a nutshell. :p

@protonjon do i need to play the other valkyria chronicles games in order to understand this one?
now for actual combat.
welp, that failed on my end. :p
its frist game starteding
honestly i thought this was an interactive movie up to this point.
what tank?
remember chat, this is the opening of a 40-60 hour strategy game. there's a loooot of story and setup. strategy gets progressively longer and tougher as the game goes on
1, 3, and 4 take place all at once. 2 takes place...2 years later.
shooting time! protonraid protonraid
so this is a $60 anime with some gameplay thrown in?
that camo netting in the middle of a plaza, haha.
that....looks like a beefed up nashorn
i thought the 3rd was later shadowzotai
@xilehnoc i know war sucks, but i meant like the actual plot.

@camille_skyloft fake france has fallen.... protonsad
mmmm… cake....
why is vc2 the lastest one in the timeline? that game has problems
carving a cake?
who parts cakes!?
@dismaldimwit ps4, switch, xbox one, pc
cake? 40 of them???
i've tried carving a cake with a machine gun. it didn't work very well.
strategery
since this is similar to va1 the turrets will destroy
@boodamedz i know that feeling.
is it swiss cake
@disgaea_demon_overlord probably similar to this but more about holding the line than advancing? somesuch
@shanewalker227 it doesn't look like it yet. the firstone happens at the same time as this one though

this game does have permadeath.

@deltaphoxtrot yeah, this is sega. fire emblem is intelligent systems.
otherwise we screwed
anti-personnel rounds?
@protonjon better on a foot soldier.
yes
yeah but in vc1 you can blow up tanks with scouts. lul
bad thing for tank
probably for the machine gun, if i had to guess
aladdin's voice sounded like troy baker
high level scouts but still
@protonjon will aladdin sing a whole new wa ?
snipers go for heads though

you might have wanted to take an engineer, they can resupply units with limited ammo. so lancers, snipers, and your tank have 3 shots each and recover one each turn, an engineer can recover all their ammo at once, by getting near a unit without full ammo

did they get rid of the outer circle that tells the player the likely spot the projectile might go
this is why players of the first game forcused on making the tank more like a sniper

sloppy is a unit trait.
not explained till later
out of ammo?!
@kuuribro how?!
that's a negative potential if i ever saw one :p
oh shoot that's like xcom panic nonsense
out of bullet
no engineer for jon, rip
well to be fair, you didn't aim in the right spot but it still took it out in one hit...so it balances it out?
don't get sloppy
@protonjon that was a potential, they activate randomly some are good and others are bad
units have potentials, both positive and negative. her negative took away ammo.
oohrah
they normally don’t come up that often
the action used up all the ammo in your shot*
protonglitch ?
@cdchow how screwed is he now?
@protonjon one of her negitive triats activated
characters have quirks good and bad
@protonjon she fired two missiles at once. that's why you saw another missile

@xilehnoc granted, its really hit or miss if that is true. but some people really care about it.
@protonjon that arrow above the target turns red when your in range
"bull's eye" *no damage*
magical cover spots that prevent headshotting, even with exposed heads. yey
it doesn't appear to be dc douglas.
d. c. douglas is not credited with a role for this game on wikipedia
i'm surprised no one noticed the narrator is sojiro from p5
@protonjon he's in the game as a character named jester mooney apparently

you haven't learned the tank duck yet
@protonjon it's nice of that tank to just sit there and let you shoot it.
it did hit guys
thats what i was worried about
@grumpingjimmy full game; he got it 2 weeks early
but we dont have any
the health went down
oh it did? my mistake
bulls**t!
huh thats new

@kuuribro so, you have a chance to save them...are htere characters that cause a game over if they die, like fire emblem?
bullsh**

the health bar on enemy tanks are in the upper left corner of the screen
oh, revival ragnaid? that's new, i think.
@xilehnoc cool. i find terra to be the easiest of the threes' areas'.
is this the demo?
ragnaid ?! bullsh** ! that's potions !
@protonjon just waiting for some apocalyptic weapon in this game to be named ragnarok
thats a yes
protonyes protonyes protonyes
no,she did not.
yes
@protonjon scouts are good to have on missions because they can see very far so they can reveal a lot of info on your map
@unhelpfulnpc if this is anything like vc1, yes.
@bronyraikou888 vc2 did take place after vc1they probably advanced in tenology or it was psp limitations
ragnaid? i think some person in my apartment complex just sprayed that recently
it's like fire emblem but better, you can recover from really bad mistakes, no reset of level needed.
@unhelpfulnpc yea, in the first game. if a key character died, its game over.
time to hunt a rathalos
@grumpingjimmy review copy.
she got one bullet
i believe her ability was that she lost ammo
her ability was she lost an extra ammo
@protonjon units reload one ammo per turn unless in a camp then they are fully loaded
@unhelpfulnpc if your tank explodes, yeah
it was a bad ability
how wood
@protonjon her ability actually made her use double ammo apparently
that health bar in the upper left corner of the screen is the health of enemy units
oops
@schmarkstar yeah he definitely seems like the one to play through first, i beat his story on ps3 back in the day before i fell off the bbs wagon so i know what to expect
well it hit at-least.
drink the shield potion
so is this advance wars?
use the bandages
blue line is good
you can use her again and move her out of danger
the deadest girl eva made.
according to dc douglas' website he did the voice for jester mooney in this game. which i am pretty sure is one of the fast scout guys.

@rocket_mayhem you make a valid point there. ...it probably wasn't limitations, based on how well the psp was able to handle birth by sleep. but was there overlapping continuity between 2 and 3? if so, then there probably wouldn't be much of a reason here.

they just skipped their turn
@schmarkstar i haven't played as aqua yet so i can't give a proper stance but ventus is my fav of the two i've played as for gameplay and terra is better for story - he feels like the main character of the main characters, if that makes sense

everyone in this game seems pretty cool with getting shot in the head
@protonjon so i assume that in this series, communism is just a red herring?
send a rocket at a turret.
headshot critical damage is negated when crouched behind cover
self-centered
maybe the mortar shot in the tank can clear those turrets
@sciesith generally speaking, some characters are just crazy compentent, but most of everyone could be somewhat useful, it's more important to get accurate weapons, as even the best will struggle with accuracy without. and as far as i can tell, you cannot win the game with just one person, and even if you could, that'd be a serious self-imposed challenge, done by those who've beaten these games before.

you have to use the tank to destroy those
this chest high wall is simply insurmountable, commander.
rsz is cannon fodder for you, huh?
in the first game you sorta just ran into it for a little bit
@xilehnoc i get what you are saying. and i also think that gameplay wise ventus is my fav. i won't say anything but aqua is the best character in terms of the story.
the dreaded insurmountable waist high fence.

you capture that flag, raz.
@xilehnoc :d :d :d yeah her va puts in a mixed performace. but she does have pretty good lines in the game. and her va has gotten better with the kh3 trailers.
freakin loved the valkyria chronicles series
@schmarkstar glad to hear it
walk over enemy bodies to get extra goodies
not only does this game get me to want to try out this series. it gets me to want to give tactics games another shot, period!
i’ll wager the enemy has no such restrictions on their numbers.
@counterpointclover it's cool when you hear it, less cool when you're under it. :p
from what i've heard, vc3 is the best in the series. which sucks since it's japan only.
hi @protonjon how are you
you could bank the cp protonjon
blow up the fence with your tank, have tank capture bas
should've had a scout
you can always bank cp
"eat your enemy's hearts to gain their strength"
reinforcements
@camille_skyloft technically, it's more cool because you get soaked and it sucks. :p

move lancer up
wow, that depletes fast...
dat posterior tho
@dantheenigma same actually

that turret is probably going to shred your foot troops. i wouldn't chance sending anything aside from the armor.

well im sold
i want to play 3 so bad!
@sciesith if you want to break the game, sure, but just to win? nah. but, i'll have to see about this 4th one, just to be sure.
@protonjon according to dc douglas' website he did the voice for jester mooney in this game. which i am pretty sure is one of the scouts.
nice!
finish the fight
valkyria chronicels are an awsome series
protoncookie protoncookie protoncookie
to not war!! octogun
i have one of those for some reason....
keep playing!
certainly looks interesting.
which one is the best one fun wise?
there is a translation patch for valkyria chronicles 3. because apparently sega doesn't want your money for it.
https://store.steampowered.com/app/790820/valkyria_chronicles_4/ $60 usd, sept 25th release day.
chat, is the steam remaster worth playing?
you have to do a play through of this
tomwelp
valkirya 1 is also on switch
yeah, revolutions is the remaster of 1 i believe
1 is coming to switch soon too.
@protonjon will you ever do a full stream of this?
and we're all waiting for valkyria chronicles....five!
@lasersniper protonwesk
@protonjon vc1 is also coming to the switch as well.
i liked it, seemed different.
i am awful at strategy games but i'm still intrigued.
valkyria revolutions was rough.
and if you don't want to but wanna watch someone else play it, i'll be doing a whole stream playthrough as soon as i'm done with xenoblade. :d i am stoked for this game
yea revolution,
@protonjon what did you think of this
!mbag
protonwhat 3 wasn't localized?! that's...what?!
comes out next month
i had chinese the other day and i saved my fortune cookie for tonight. protoncookie
its wild that the games go 1, 2, and 4
revolution is the bad one
it's coming to switch next month
revolution was it's own game
would not recommend revolution unless you just have to have every valkyria game
revolutions is definitely the black sheep, it's not really a tactics game from what i'm told.
in october
nice
oh :o
eeeeeeeeeeeeeh i am so excited for this game
i have 1 remastered for the ps4, but i haven't played it yet.

what was perfection?
rip vod.
it is so un synced
i really hate this since i'm always hearing this song at work

not the same key\
@protonjon i mean, wasn't the point to ruin the song?
i don't know either of these songs, so yeah =x
impeach this egg!
vods not muted... yet
i feel more like perfect was ruined more than persona there
not even close....
it gets it here and there, but it's not a uniform mash
thumbs down. boo this man
just play the katamari one again.

@protonjon hey, i just wanted to thank you for your stream making me blow the fuck up in subs recently :)
@anonymous_jr yeah, at times, it really blended well.
there's a pure tonal and pace difference in the two songs
i liked it.
@mcjohnson88 same we must be old and out of the loop :p
...what caused that bottom-right gif?
what inspired that egg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypgy2d2xb1a
clue solution : vod was murdered by smurp in the stream room with a persona 5 ost
i mean at least the last one didn't mute the vod
mario kart ds for the psp
@mcjohnson88 the music was the instrumental version of "life will change" from persona 5. not sure what the singing was
mario kart ds! for da super gameboy!
@mistahben @hellx1b2 dude, be respectful. don't call for a pile-on party.
that nickel back be was legendary
mario kart ds for vr
the singing was "perfect" by ed sheeran.
cheer1
mario kart ds is for the virtual boy kappa
https://clips.twitch.tv/empathicaggressivecocoacurselit
what was that ed sheeran song mashed up with?
can people still play online on mario kart ds?
uh oh?
does to bottom middle say "thats sad" or "rad"
jon i can here you
rad.
rad
nope
not legitimately, anyway
i hear things in the background. xd
@darkfireyoshi no
nope @darkfireyoshi
husbands should be like kleenex
thats rad
@darkfireyoshi no, that got discontinued back in 2014 i think?
@meganerd20 something from persona 5. but it wasn't great.
that's rad
mario kart ds for psp?
currently watching tim play persona 5. looking cool joker!

@alan_m00ch ah, that would explain why i didn't recognize it
it honestly didn't work like the katamari mashup.
@counterpointclover still working for me
...chat's not freaking out. i'm refreshing. :p
anything with nintendo wfc is dead, except for mario kart wii thanks to mrbean35000vr
@phaz0nedge dammit, i've been wondering when he'd do that. is this the first stream?
@counterpointclover stream's still running
@use_name12 his son stayed out too late.
i'll drop this again: btw, chat. it's subtember. if you have a sub gift that can be renewed before the 30th, you can renew your gift sub to jon for $1. this applies to a gift sub you got from last month to even today.
does anybody know what the intermission music is?
protonegg protonegg
@chibiwhitemageamy yeah, i just had to refresh. thanks, though. ^^
no mario kart ds was definitely on the wonderswan
@meganerd20 i actually enjoyed the nickleback/owl city/katimari mashup. that was a good one
pause music (pizza time) from a game boy ninja turtles game @shanewalker227
@counterpointclover np
wheres the original egg sound? i want to make an egg from clue
mario kart ds was actually the first nintendo game to have online play
!egg
@magnolias no it's an attari game
there's a command for that, i don't remember what it was
i was wondering what the twitter music was, personally.

@myohel0 did you say "pizza time?" oh nooooo... dr. connor's claaaaaaaaass...

here's the default egg sound if you would like to make your own: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nus5svbltykguaq/egg.wav?dl=0

does anyone play mario kart ds with the jokers still in the deck?

rip wfc
be rob
he does. and he has rob.
missions
lul good going jon

aren't the servers dead?
better than switch wifi kappa
oh yeah! i had one of those before i got a router/modem so many years ago.
he's unlocked everything.
@protonjon may or may not be unpopular opinion, but i think this mario kart game may have the best soundtrack of any of teh mario kart games. that may be nostalgia talking though. specifically for teh menu music.
they really got a lot of mileage out of that menu design on ds, jeez.

excavator...
so he's that guy's son
gee, i wonder what jon will use?
wario has a tractor
why does waluigi drive a construction vehicle?
r.o.b.
a backhoe?
@protonjon how was movie night yesterday?
bulldozer
protoncop
oh my god his kart is gyros
he has a fucking excavator!!
wascoop
@protonjon waluigi's gold mantis is a reference to foreman spike from wrecking crew
wonderfully compressed wah's
backhoe, you people
@dgtl_ronin042 thanks.
it's a snork!
drybones tank!
his bulldozer is based off wrecking crew
maybe he can use that to dig his way into smash
r.o.b for mk9
or a cheat code kappa
egg
@protonjon use the plane!
nope...
smg4 pretty much made waluigi a god
use the smallest kart possible
how many people here first saw rob in this game before smash?
not the missions, i beat them all but don't have all the karts
use the egg!
finish the whole grind prix.
r.o.b. was great
waluigi = foreman spike(?), and that’s called a backhoe
go with the yoshi cart cucumber
waluigi in a tank!
i activate vehicle of construction @protonjon
this is where i thought it would be cool if nintendo rebooted wario and waluigi as the wrecking crew
that was the mirror mode grand prix
the ex-pelled smash character driving the ex-cavator
and the item stat....it's interesting.
tractor the fuck?!?
rambi
yes
pretty much
tank!
yes
i usually used a heavy character with the dry bomber.
the tank what
a tank
protonsad
beat every cup in every engine mode
rob a cool addition in this game
i forgot about waluigi's victory dance in mkds!
yoshi’s cart is also good

200cc in ds please?
@protonjon r & l do things.
r is drift
@protonjon left right left right for drift boosting
@protonjon try snaking
you can really spam it hard
@myohel0 so more cc = faster ai?
@protonjon you don't remember the buttons
blue falcon was for mk8 as dlc.
in wii and 8 i believe you can get the blue falcon
a is win
race daisy on hard lul
l is items
i thought blue falcon was only mk8
remember that fake tweet that made its rounds about nintendo adding the golf cart from fortnite as a playable kart in mk8d? @protonjon
gosh, i put so much time in this game.
"do i remember how to drive?" here's to hoping. :p
i only had the wii u vc version
@xilehnoc just faster in general
i fucking hated snaking
there are no tricks @protonjon
lul
i forgot how fast paced it looked
this is so snes...
it was such bullshit
@myohel0 big off
this game doesn't have tricks
for some reason dk in my game would always hit the bananas
@protonjon when i learned that there would be throw back stages in mario kart ds, i thought they would make a special "rainbow cup" that had the past rainbow roads.
snaking
that timing
this has a back and forth exploit no?
it's difficult to go back to after both mario kart 7 and 8 came out
go jon! do the game, win the thing!!
shockdodge
that star timing tho
shock dodge!
@xilehnoc more aggresive ai. with 150 they pratically spam items.
lucky star !
i remember learning how to snake in this game, it was amazing

good star timing there.

@protonjon fun story, when i had this game, my dsi has a broken r button, so i played, and tripled starred, the entire game, without drifting.
oh..and remember to rapidly press left and right while drifting to get speed boosts
snaking?
welp dk is dead
forgot about that part
@protonjon what is the differnece between rear-wheel drive and front-wheel drive?
what is snaking date i ask?
solid snaking

@protonjon waluigi is put into a butterfly stretch when he drives

@protonjon what is your opinion on all the rainbow roads in mario karts?
pro wrestling is the first ever fire pro game technically
spooky scary protondeath
@protonjon @dantheenigma@medz the nes emulator already got hacked and people have added their own roms
also the speed boost is mario kart double dash speed boost
@just_happi no, that's drafting.
it's a very bad kinnikuman wrestling nes game
btw how good were any of the nes sport games?
my childhood is here
hot take: pro wrestling games didn't get good at all until the n64/ps1 era

@protonjon what is snaking??
@dantheenigma have you played ikaruga in the past?
oh my god! so many stairs! i'd like to find whoever invented the stairs, and push him down these stairs, just to show him how stupid stairs are! then his legs will be broken, and he will no longer be able to climb the stairs any more! it'll be ironic, and then his wife will leave him and go be with the man who invented the elevator, because everyone knows that elevators are much sexier than stairs, and oh my god, i'm not even close to being at the top yet, why are there so many stairs?!?

@protonjon why did you not pick yoshi's egg kart for waluigi?
no, that still works.

oh...that's not what i expected for that term of power sliding all the time to be*
@naotoplays and it doesn't feel like it's improved.
oh.
that's really good.
that's good.
@protonjon on that topic,what do you think of the ps classic news?
that's a nice feature
snaking essentially is drifting to one direction then imediately to the opisite then back coninously to gain alot of speed from drift boosts(the tire flares), this works best on ds and slightly slower double dash
oh man, that's smart
cool
good call...
but it's still p2p.
that's actually really good
the higher waluigi’s voice gets the lower wario’s gets
@dantheenigma interestingly the japanese side has some famicom disk system titles.
that one i thought it was called drafting*
blue shell
spiny shell!
at least when playstation went to paid online it improved\
@phoxphorus a strageaty game and some eggs
hopefully they can fix the whole burning issue
but there's no suspend feature, so you need to actually save before quitting out of the game.
blue hell?
wondering where that blue spiny shell was
it's 100% real
@protonjon as someone not familiar with grand mario kart skills, what is snaking and why is it so "game breaking"?
yeah
protonfinish
someone put granddad 7 on nes switch
@schmarkstar thanks
i mean, we've already got sprite rips from tons of switch games.
oh boy combat amphibians
didn't believe it
the catch is if your sub is gone the save dats is gone too
nesflix is pretty much note for note the same as the nes classic
protonfinish
the switch emulator is a poor port of the nes classic emulator
there's literally just an emulatior in there and you put the rom files in
we're calling it nesflix now? lul brilliant
@ultaki nooooooo
we modded our snes classic and added more games. it is awesome!
@0zenaki0 if this were mkwii, jon would have been hit with 3 of them by now. :p
protoncop protoncop protoncop protoncop protoncop protoncop
2 in a row!
oh this course!
@magusandrus basically just drifting back and forth on straightaways to get more speed
drifting gives a speed boost after blue ftire flares
this one....
snaking is power drifting all the time
i've always liked this track. :)
this is really making me wanna play this game again
my favorite track on this game
@bigdregamer i would have to agree
roms are bad
oh, i love sky garden!
is it just me, or did it look like waluigi waved his arms like kermit when he got hit by the blue shell?
@bigdregamer yeah, they are cheap with that.
this track is so nice
puts roms in a emulator
weegee
its broken because it allows for easy speed boosts
genius
since the roms in there are .nes files
sky garden has such good music kreygasm
i never got to play this course unfortunately
@celebison_m high five! masaeyay
gba mario kart was my first mario kart.
they pretty much took the software from the nes classic and made it compatible with switch.
and they wonder why they get shit about emulaters
i rememebr sky garden
; -;
omg
no online uses the same stuff as the nes classic
its basically the same as the (s)nes classic editon
ikaruga is on sale right now.
lucahhello lucahhello lucahhello
so drifting then moving left/right till the tire flares go blue let go gives a speed boost
and i know the shortcuts on this track.
wait, this explains why they attacked rom sites
>tfw no nes pattys
also i've experienced more lag with the payed internet than i did before hand
snes joycon controller icons were datamined a while back so expect those sometime
yeah, what's the smb3 special edition all about?

it's nintendo. who knows what they're going to do, in general?
it's worrisome
dd1 had both
can confirm
@protonjon soooooooo much final fantasy the switch is gettting
but how will i be able to play all my favorite simple ass games from 30 years ago without nintendo switch
you can plug the snes classic into the computer and just add more games. it was so easy and there was lots of room :) thanks nintendo
wait, they said what would be coming next to nes online?
@protonjon for splatoon 2 at least if you sub for the full year you get codes for some exclusive gear
@protonjon this emulator situation is clearly the reason they attacked rom sites
hell why is fucking yoshi in the collection and not metroid.
another blue shell?!
metroid is being added in november
i think the last time a product didn't sell well and they decided to double down on it was the 3ds
snaking takes advantage of drift boost by making them happen faster dry bones is the best for snaking
double spiny protonwhat
snake.
why isnt metroid there by default
snake?
they probably did it because dd2 is on the minines
snaaaaaaaaaake.
ka-bluey
game is trying to save jon 1st place. :d
snake? snake!? snaaaaake!!
is there drifting in ds
ohhh.
"snaking" is building boost by drifting on a straightaway.
constantly mini-turboing, basically
@naotoplays rip emu paradise
drifting back and forth basically.
snaking dansgame
it's almost like firehopping but not quite
2 blue shells?
also ds introduced blue shell armageddon
it's like drifting in a straight line
@protonjon @boodamedz @dantheenigma is nintendo ever planning on releasing gamecube games at some point? and by any means, i mean. not just nintendo switch online.
freaking yoshi
i think tecmo bowl is in there as a contract compromiose to get ninja gaiden in there
yoshi stole first
also i know zelda 1 is a classic
dang
oh, so it's basically what people do with crash nitro kart
sniped
and drifting on striaghtaways
yoshi wins! :d

they specifically changed the mini-turbo mechanic for mkwii because of snaking in ds
getting stars is really hard in this and wii iirc
lul i just realized yoshi, donkey kong, and waluigi are in the top three. it's basically the runaway guys only not!
this is the game where it's most broken i believe
@soylent_chef you mean skerpentine drifting? protonchugga protonchugga protonchugga
@mistahben lul
i don't understand how the speed boost works in double dash honestly
up until wii, in order to get a mini turbo from drifting, you have to alternate left and right. it's not like modern mario karts where drifting a certain distance gives you the mini turbo.
as someone who played a decent amount of mario kart ds and knew how to snake....i can't snake for the life of me in double dash. wtruck
i streamed this track on double dash a while back, and someone in my chat was like, "oh, i just noticed it looks like a yoshi!" :d
no. emile is not daisy anymore.
tetris! pattyo
@protonjon where do you think mario kart ds ranks in terms of mario kart games?
daisy
oh, so mario kart ds aye? neat, so, how's everyone's nights been going
not gonna lie, i am praying to see like, ff1 or one of the first few dragon quests show up on the nes online.
who owns tetris?
emile is toad
@protonjon @dantheenigma @boodamedz have you guys heard about bowsette?
i know its also the rapid left and right presses but it doesn't feel as worth doing*

i own tetris
even though nintendo could easily afford the tetris license
poor chrono trigger

@protonjon @dantheenigma @boodamedz just want to point out now that after a couple months of being absent, i'm back to helping out with gs stuff again. i'm feeling a lot better than before.
square made a racing rpg called racing lagoon. one of the vehicles you can drive in it is a box truck. you can put a wide body kit and wing on it. it's great.
@phoxphorus the wedding is in a week

some of these got recycled as mkwii online challenges iirc.

five stars! a+ four stars!

@protonjon you get rob by getting gold in all grand prixs

hit him jon.
hit him really hard
king boo stole your coins. hit him
win a gold trophy in all cups in retro mirror mode in the 150cc class to unlock r.o.b.
im gonna wreck it

it weird that king boo isn’t fighting luigi in this case
@protonjon make him dead again
this king boo boss was the worst!
drive into the boss
drive through him
stay under him
run into him
run into his butt?
i think there was a "verse the ghost devs" in time trials if you set a certain time record for a track @protonjon
from behind
how kill?
protonwhat protonwhat
@protonjon to unlock r.o.b., players have to win the mirror special cup

it was awful.
lul
the less you mention sa, the better lul
maybe they quoted it because it sounded lood? raccattack
@protonjon is something awful even around still?
i sadly do still know what it is.
pretty much
yeah
it was a let's play community, it was involved with the start of let's plays
protongood
good job jon lul
what's "something awful" ?
it was...something awful kappa

@protonjon is it something aweful?
sa had goodwill?
lul
@protonjon what is a "something awful?"

not prerecorded lul
let's just say it was something awful
so they're living up to their name, now?
feelin' saucy! kappa
how is the snow down in calgary today?
not a jonbot!
@tidaltempest45 i can confirm its still a thing
i guess you could say it was something awful keepo
it was probably something awful...
but sa has had a rocky history afterwards
:d
lul
suuure kappa
verified
peach just melted into liquid
this game really makes you feel like a mario kart
lul lul
getting at least one star on each mission at least unlocks an extra mission
i'm still not convinced kappa
it really lives up to its name now huh? kappa
@myohel0 what happen
because it was"something awful," right?
lul
dang, so mario karat ds is 13 years old?

@protonjon i find it hard to believe anything that could spin 4chan out if it had good will to begin with
iirc i think you can dodge the boo attack if you intentionally jump in the lava before he strikes.
star rank is like 4 minutes i think
wah

if you guys watch arcade pit on smight's twitch channel, you'll see a lot of the good cool people from something awful. the cream of the crop.
but the game hasn't glitched. we only have proof someone is playing, not jon

@protonjon “to unlock r.o.b. in mkds, players have to win the mirror mode special cup”
c is for cookie that's good enough for me.
yeah
use his own children against him!
@myohel0 to be fair, they might also have quoted "go into him" for lewdness factor, and not for criticism?
hit bombs with bombs
something awful is why we have the let's play archive, iirc
did he blow himself up?
i wanna see "hit the big human with three smaller humans" next
the something awful story is extremely long and complex, it's probably best to research it on your own if you're curious
genocider syo
@protonjon so, i know of sa, but when you saw your old contacts, their picture was a swastika... ummmmmm
i think he blew himself up
he hit himslef lul
did not receive*
did he just hit himself?!
the king bob-omb's kind of cute! :d
i think he blew himself up
i was sh ther wer missions in newer mario karts
wait, did he... hit himself with his own bomb?
wait did king bob-omb hit himself?
@dantheenigma that's regicide, dan. you're killing the king.
i never heard of something awful
like how bad was it
once again, there was goodwill?

he ran into a bomb at the start
well i guess you can say that they did..... something awful
he ran into his own bomb trap.
protonbomb

you knocked him into his own bomb
he hit himself.
even when good outweighs the bad, the bad is better advertised.
must've ran into one...
woot
@protonjon he blow himself up before you hit him.
you'll find the cream of the crop/best of the community in the arcade pit community nowdays

@myohel0 pit crew is formed to branch away from the original sa goons, i think
he tried to rocket jump.
@protonjon you and slender man came from the same place. ever thought about that? (didn't see if this went through the first time)
can someone draw the waluigi mowing the lawn for me? i for the life of me can't draw a lawn mower
this one sucks
ice bully
i definitely heard jon say cheep chilly just then
to unlock r.o.b., players have to win the mirror special cup
wario is number one
ugh! chief chilly was the worst.
use the boost to get through?
warning...this one rushes
@kyon2570 that would make sense
chief chilly is just such a great boss name
this one is my least favorite
!impeach
hey jon. phoenixg404 doesn't like this game anymore! switch the game up! :(

@blackdinothunderranger = after break. :)
what's on twitter?
@dantheenigma @boodamedz did you guys see the thing that happened in pokémon go?
i think he was going to be fucking with his wife
i actually took that at face value
he was a plant. he actually wasn't gay.
@protonjon police squad for movie night?
@tnt175 the code will be open when jon makes the room
christopher lloyd was in that movie?
quick question- does anyone know the song that plays during jon's mini raid? or is it something special that's only for his use?
kiryu <3
the whole thing is that mr. green was being blackmailed for being gay.
fu- buffering-ck
treecko dance like he on footloose
looks like i did the butler
i'm the buttler. i buttle
everything you were told about him at the beginning was a lie.

this is radiohead
that's the law!
@protonjon @dantheenigma @boodamedz do you almost get the feeling that the people behind the clue servers are doing this on purpose? :p
it'll say incorrect code if the lobby's full

i know tim murdered jon with a toilet
well...... go medz! you can do it! :d
and don't say what cards you have out loud
murder board! murder board! murder board!
@colinus in the bathroom
better hope the statute of limitations hasn't run out on any of these murders, or you're sol.
its jon hes always the murder kappa
medz never played clue?!?! what?!?!
protonegghd protonegghd
candelabra as a weapon? is this the phantom of the opera?
someone never played clue!? nani!?
@alan_m00ch i haven't either
@protonjon bitboss is blocking the bottom of the list again
how does one use a lute as a weapon
clearly it was with the parasol
i do remember jon murdering his teammates in the new super mario games quite a bit.
i remember playing a board game of this
i've only played clue two or three times x3
i have not played clue in a very long time.
i played the board game not the steam version
i like how there's a sword in the weapons section.
thinking about it,it'd be very easy to guess the method,if you could actually see the body.
it was meee lol
@jacktrevorxd i haven't either.
@redlinkkid that's because it is
i actually got lucky in a game where i won on my first turn in this
@wrennemun = shove it down their windpipe? shoot a dart out of one end?
!uptime
protonjon has been streaming for: 3 hours 3 minutes 17 seconds
@blackdinothunderranger dio?
parasol best weapon though.
this is a game of trickery
iiii guess?
lute as a weapon?
mustard, sword, arcade. trust me. i'm clairvoyent kappa
wait, is it a lute, or a crossbow?
it was me. i murdered bambi's mom.
amyone else see the movie clue with tim curry? it's incredible
lute = el kabong raysfox
so why do people have different weapons on their lists?
how do you kill someone with a lute protonwhat protonwhat protonwhat protonwhat protonwhat
i'll lute you to death
good start
i like how jon explains things... makes it easy to understand in mist situations
@mikeyoverrated that was movie night yesterday
by playing despacito on it, that's how
but was it the golden lute
plum looks like he's cussing the corpse out
octo200iq
raysq
@ozzyman314 blunt force to the head
@remolay cosmetic dlc
im going to bounce. have a good one jon and chat
and the weapon of your choice.... will lead to your death, toniiiiight!!!
bludgeon i guess? maybe? a lute seems a little flimsy for that
btw players don't look at jon's stream for his cards
you can use cards you have to help narrow down other things in a suggestiong
presumably the weapons and rooms have equivalents in different themes
its good to understand the tiny marks
@protonjon can you move the bit boss meter please
@remolay it's because of the dlc. if you have a different tileset, the murder weapons change based on the theme
professor plum did nothing wrong within the context of the movie.
good night @ceiebison_m
@spiritofwatermontaru dang i missed it. one of my all-time favs
@protonjon since a lute was used: floooooooooooooooow my teaaaaaaaaaaaaars.
@admiralaardvark i salute you for that crypt of the necrodancer reference
if the killer is yourself, it really doesn't matter....
hes dead
hypnotic lute sounds, the perfect murder kappa
what
colonel mustard is always the murderer
protonluck
it could be you. it could be me! it could even be--
so hold up, nobody knows if they're the killer? ...what is this, the hangover? lul
jon goes into teacher modd.
mostlyits jon
*mode
i have never seen the film
nah i get that it's dlc, i just don't understand why it isn't consistant between players
wait, has jon killed somebody more than once?
people speedrun an old version of clue by instantly guessing the answer and reseting until it’s correct.
"i think i did the murder! oh no! i have a knife!"
does anyone of the jekyll and hyde musical and the specific song "murder, murder", because thats what i thought of just know
one in six means it's always jon
3/10 not enough tim curry kappa
jon is a good teacher
and then they're boddy....he's dead. protonsad
it was the butler!
can confirm
there's*
plum is clearly tim curry tho
not a low roll for jon!
watching this i realized that i've been playing clue wrong for years
which version of the clue movie did you watched?
@protonjon is that colonel mustard just sean bean?
@protonjon the game watches for anyone with the tag "protonjon" and weights the killer to that player ;)
"i have murdered you all!" -jon, new super mario bros. u
protonwhat
what?
you monster!
isn't that just a confession?
wow this arcade sucks
#jonneverstabbedadude
where are the arcade machines?
where's the video games???
who actually suggested that
protonjon has finally banned himself kappa
this is the worst arcade ever kappa
lul
"it has all come down to this moment!"
that's the arcade? where's the games?
i can prove it kappa
jon, you didn't need to test my theory lol
barrsting
oh my god you can actually accuse yourself, i only said that as a joke.
@protonjon "i murdered this dude, change my mind"
where is the fishing game?
"i did it! prove me wrong!" :d
he came down with a killer case of pac-man fever
ok wow jon you aren't even slightly dressed appropriate for this ball, rude kappa
in real life, what would other people respond if you accuse yourself?
#neverkilledaman
@mrskerpentine doki doki delet this kappa
we already know it's jon we just don't know how you kappa
worst arcade ever. 0/10 not even a pac man macine
i'm gonna turn myself in for murder in exchange for willing a board game!
or the game where the ball lands in a hole to give you tickets???
it's a race! i hope i win.
this professor plum looks like jeff goldblum
that's one hell of a coin... o_o
@mariokart2014 skeeball.
the primary definition of arcade a covered passageway with arches along one or both sides.
remember when we had to use the chart manually
lol
mama, just killed a man...
lul
lul
is the lute a crossbow?
colonel custard with the candlestick in the balloons m, i win
@protonjon sometimes i will chance it and make a guess if i think i wont get another turn
how do you kill with a lute?
@spotulip jeff goldplum?
what does the numbers do?
nice cinematic parallels
@mariokart2014 skeeball?
beat a guy with a lute, that just harsh, i'll make a note of it
you use it like an axe guitar
why are you marking them with 1's @protonjon ?
@protonjon what are you marking numbers for?
the more i see you play this, the more i realize how mch me and my sister got wrong
oh shit, you can put numbers by your question marks? i didn't know that
where's pinball in the arcade? you what i say as a gamer? disappointed!!!
blunt force trauma
what do you mean, "very interesting?" it was stupid.
you play the lute so poorly that another person dies
mama, just killed a man. ill hide the boddy
i have done that
numbers are probably how many guesses pinged it
@meganerd20 whoops :p
@alan_m00ch oh no, it's a different game. they have it at dave and busters
i'm not smart enough to fully understand this game still teaderp
we are beating super mario maker in views.
@thefa56 jon uses the numbers to keep track of frequency.
!call
do you remember the time when jon never knew these guys: dan ( https://www.twitch.tv/dantheenigma ) and medz ( https://www.twitch.tv/boodamedz )? jon was young and innocent then.
speaking of vincent, the mods are playing a game, and two of the mods got replaced by ai. it's only a matter of time before the last one gets replaced :p
i forget the name of it
the dog did it
yeah.... then you should play roulette and bet on 0. you'll probably win. ;)
oh mama, i'm in fear for my life from the long arm of the law.
oh my gosh, this version of white has a dog!
i'll find it
the pupper no roocry
she's got a doggy! :d
yeah, that's the best way to play is with numbers.
awooo
attack doggo!
the dog's face
oh my god
so why did you use 1 twice?
woof
@dantheenigma you're playing as my personal favorite character. ...christopher lloyd. kappa
do you prefer the snes/genesis version of showing what happens to everybody instead of just showing a card to a single person?
@protonjon are you sure the other players aren't looking at your stream?
oh hey we made it back to clue!
@lazyrpgfan because it's in different columns.
she has a wolf
so... like an actual detective?
i'm sending that on twitter
that was their first guess, second guess etc. etc.
she has a fucking murder wolf
"find out he was white"
man, white has a wolf.
@alan_m00ch it's called slam-a-winner
bad dog
ooooooooooh i get it now, that's pretty smrt cirderp
pretty much how i play it
awooooo
@protonjon is the murderer always one of the players?
tiegrin
this is too complex for my fragile young 18 year-old mind
"it was me i did it" -everybody
is he... accusing himself?
tearu
ohmydog
is orchid a dlc character
@mariokart2014 never been to dave-and-busters.
deadly umbrella
murder dog
bork
my brain can barely handle go feesh
so i'm used to skeeball.
david tennant murdered a dalek
we're all the murderer
wowee
@unhelpfulnpc not necessarily.
with a parsol
this parasol is not an umbrella! kappa
not always @unhelpfulnpc
how does one kill with a para- oh wait wasnt there that one spy that killed someone like that
how the hell can you kill someone with a umbrella anyway? o_o
popper
that's... an odd way to murder with a parasol
stabby rainy
this game would be more fun if mrs. white was betty white.
green must be swole if he can kill with a umbrella
in the ballroom !
umbrella gun
thats how
"it was me, mustard"
logic victory lul
lul
@alan_m00ch yeah, i think it's an exclusive there
who it is doesnt matter
confessing
if mustard is the murder, i'm so done
lul
i win
lul
@h2ohappydude you hit them very hard. or shove it down their throat.
clue but you kill the others is another board game
2
i commited murder! where's my prize?
i mean you still win
0
i have the right to remain silent!
you win by losing. :d
it was me all along!
it was i! in the hall. with the revolver.
++
@mariokart2014 ah.
@protonjon you all just have amneisa
plot twist: boddy was the murderer all along.
"i am under arrest!"
it was me, austin!
i win! my win
when justice is served, everyone wins!
in the physical game, 3 cards are hidden to determine what's correct
yeah, being the murderer doesn't affect the outcome of the game.
lul
i've been to that bridge
@thefa56 8 years kappa
you are filled with a sudden guilt
you thought it was someone else, but it was i dio!
"ah, son of a bitch!
lul
jokes on you me i did it
it's like all the times you wanted to turn yourself in to collect the bounty
@protonjon "i won! i'm going to jail, but i won!"
i was the blackened the whole time
lul
gasp
@protonjon it's actually a ditto that took on your shape, and you're accusing your own doppleganger. kappa
or the one that it's based one
"cool motive. still murder"
@alan_m00ch look it up. it's actually very fun
"and i would have gotten away with it, too, if not for...myself?"
ha! i win! now arrest me!
@protonjon the clue society is weird that if you admit to murder, you get no punishment
also the person who did the murder doesn't know they did the murder
@boodamedz i'm the murderer boy! i'm the one who wins!
"oh hey peacock,, you're innocent. don't worry"
bottom room is covered by the overlay again.
i love how now everyone's guessing themselves now
lol... the lute
"ha! you fools, i did it!" *shows handcuffs*
i mean, the winner in the true ending of the movie killed mr. boddy and admitted to it it in one of the last lines.
brb
i did done do the murder
wow
@protonjon what is the turn order for revealing evidence?
i guess orchid isnt from the original clue cast shes dlc
is this game online?
!call
@themaniacalgamer that's a spoiler! go to the spoiler chat! kappa
do you remember the time when jon never knew these guys: dan ( https://www.twitch.tv/dantheenigma ) and medz ( https://www.twitch.tv/boodamedz )? jon was young and innocent then.
@protonjon we can't see the bottom of your card because of the bitboss
this game looks so fun
jon, please move the bit boss.
kinda odd
sorry? no, that's the wrong game! kappa
can we just play sorry?
its also weird that you have to prove you are guilty
i liked the snes version, where instead of it going "person is arrested" "victory comment", it goes "victory comment", "you're arrested", "parting comment"... i think.
man, a lot of people want to admit they're the murderer
@protonjon can you move the bit boss?
it was a lovely view for murder
@protonjon bitboss is blocking the bottom... again.
@protonjon i mean, mr body is usually known as a terrible person who kind of deserved to die most of the time.
"so where did the murder take place?" "i don't know maybe the room with the rotting body, but i could be wrong."
mrs. plumb? didn't she play jan brady?
so every stream?
xd
you get more punishment for assuming someone else as the murderer than murdering someone and telling everyone.
murder isn't a crime in the clue-niverse. it's how they keep the population in check.
@protonjon is orchid supposed to be edna mode if she didn't suffer from stunted growth and nearsightedness? kappa
wheeeeeeee
wheeeeeee
lul
i love how they set up the cosmetic stuff to still allow easy play regardless of what each player chose.
do you have to show your card?
yay :)
zoom
https://clips.twitch.tv/slicksaltyhamsterlitfam
@dragonlord_carter you would be right on that.
god the kenshiro icon...
nyooom
wheee~
now it's blocking the settings button. kappa
i hope to play jon in this sometime
lets just play clue for the rest of the night kappa
i remember you got snake eyes and lost the game @protonjon
if you have evidence of innocence, you must show it. think of it as brady material.
no you're blocking the settings button the most important button
oof
rip jon's luck
i wasn't in the game but i know it happened
protonluck
classic proton jon
ok i've known this game for a long time but why now am i thinking of danganronpa?
@protonjon but you can block someone from going in that room
mario party rolls strike back
protonluck
brutal, but not all that bad.
danganronpa clue tho
it's pretty unlucky when you roll too low.
i don't know why but mustard reminds me of sean bean.
id buy it
@protonjon "shit luck"? so your luck?
so who are the players and who are the ai?
lul
lul
can you not mark which cards you’ve shown to people? so if you have two choices you always show them the same card?
professor plum looks psychotic d:
you sure? myohelraven

so so salty.
rfcsalt rfcsalt rfcsalt
there's a turn limit?!?!?!?!
yeah definitely not. . .
projecting a little bit huh?
tsk tsk...
sometimes its better to just make the guess and hope for luck if you wont get another turn
@protonjon sounds like your rolls in maro party!
was this recent?
it's not coming to personal experience... or so i want you to think
@protonjon pjsalt pjsalt pjsalt
peacock with the poison! aaaaah!
that's not how you poison someone.

you know what that says, neo? know thyself

#medzneverkilledaman
so think of it as like that natural one from dnd
we know its a sword
i knew it
i knew i couldn't trust you
xd
true i'd buy danganronpa clue. that would be a lot of characters tho
why does the poison look like it's just whacking people with the bottle.
@guygasher not a turn limit, but you are trying to figure it out before everyone else, and when someone else says they're close, you want to rush.
@protonjon that was a house rule of ours to not accuse yourself
i knew you were a bad man
lul
@guygasher the only time limit is how long it takes for someone to find out the solution. so anywhere from one turn to about 10+ turns
peacock, why did you blugeon that man with the bottle of poison
you know what my favorite start is? when you have 3 room cards
it narrows down the rooms so much
guys, there's danganronpa clue on tabletop
trust nobody, not even yourself
@protonjon as murder weapons go, poison isn't that violent, really
dangan ronpa clue would be amazing oh my god
wait what
wow.
oh what come on why did you walk into the knife oh mom's gonna kill me man
really?
#medskillaman
although, to be fair, nobody can trust dan. kappa
that fire crackle
@boodamedz "why does this keep happening?! protonthump "
why do people around me die!?1
what isn’t meds always dying though
oh shit for real @xenodanganmonicals
trust no one, especially yourself.
@inshone okay thank you
@protonjon let's be honest, the people are just the worst forensic scientists. they just be guessing
looking this up now
i can see it now. @boodamedz walks into a room and goes, "damn it. i murdered again."
wait really
@myohel0 i thought stephen was the bad man
i would rather guess and try to win on luck than lose beffore my next turn
@wrennemun and which game would be the base? one for each entry?
@leinim yeah, it's in the steam workshop
wouldn't that be considered turning yourself in?
what about a house rule where you have to accuse yourself first? kappa
the cops must be real bad at their jobs if they can't tell whether someone was shot or not.
lul
@protonjon if anyone the murderer is jon cause without him these games would not have happened and mr. body would not die
protoncheer100 go protonjon!
@zoroarkarceus123 probably
danganronpa clue set in hope's peak academy would be awesome.
lul
but the real question is where's the caveman?
xd
caaarrrrllll
so who's shadow killed the victim?
i just remember when someone did the final accusation the cards would be shown even if they get it wrong
37? how specific
carl that kills people!
caaaaaarrrrrrlllll
that kills people! d:
carrrrrrlll
he fell on to some bullets
ccccccccaaarrlllll
caaaaaarrrrrrrlllll
what happened to his hands?
caaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaarrrrl
mustard was a salty murdered
bill!
well, there was that stream where medz forced himself to eat a dorito with a giant transformer and refused to.
he walked into my knife. he walked into my knife 6 times.
@protonjon oh no... mr. boddy's murder... i got so caught up in what i was doing that i forgot all about it... he's gonna kill me...
caaaaaaaaaaaaarl
liama's with hats is actually pretty dark at the end

llamas with hats, now that's some old memes pogchamp
oh, isabelle
28 stab wounds!

at least it wasn't 666 times, carl.
@protonjon how good do you consider the phone version?

"carl what is wrong with you!" "well i kill people and i eat hands, that's two things"
its always mustard for the most part*

@protonjon has this jsut starting to become a stream regular?
the adventures of carl

"whitey gotta pay, and the payment is baby hands"
it's the same version

it's the same game.

how good do you consider the snes version @protonjon
protoncheer1 protoncheer1 protoncheer1 protoncheer1 protoncheer1
you didn't answer the question myohelraven
@dantheenigma @boodamedz shh! do you hear that? ...that's the sound of forgiveness.
i will say that i do like people dropping bits even when they don't trigger alerts.
it is the same thing

beat me to it xd
good evening everyone
imagine how crazy this game would be if the murder was someone in the chat
can i buy a skin for mr body please
i prefer tilt controls...
i also play the mobile version.
well... its not tilt controls kappa
it looks like there's a version of clue based on the first dr game in the steam workship
piethink
i work retail, can't have phone feelsbadman
how do you kill a guy with a parasol?
so not bad
is this the new baz?
yay! irresponsibility
it's a good game
@protonjon is this replacing bomberman act zero?
im back who did jon kill kappa
i g o t s o c a u g h t u p i n w h a t i w a s d o i n g . . .
i mean, this game's gonna be on the next sub game night. it's not even a question.
question: why does this game have a $35 season pass?
i think it has been at this point
its not coincidental if someone picked it
that was me with monopoly
stab them with the pointy stick
i'm irresponsible as is, watching this stream at work
carl why is the boat all read and sticky?
cause it has a lot of dlc
so whos mr.body in clue lore just a random dude?
@metalvictini with a nice smasssshhhh hit to the head
how do you kill with a parasol?
roothink hmm. where could the murderer be hiding?
oh thank god!
@protonjon does this game still update?
even if you don't have the dlc, you can play with people who have the dlc
ever seen a spy movie?
my family owned a lot of board games...can't remember if this was one of them.
yep
as much as i love crime shows, i have never played clue
mr. boddy is either the host or the antagonist. maybe both?
@techaoss if the tip is sharp enough?
@protonjon will it end up being tradition to play clue at least once a week?
how much is the base game out of curiousity?
mr body is the guy blackmailing everybody @ogrimmar45678
my parents loved this game...but then we ran out of the paper sheets and stopped playing
rip teltale
the comestics are all worth though
$12 @themaniacalgamer
so only get the season pass if you're one of those people who must have everything in the game.
!impeach play sorry
hey jon. mariokart2014 doesn't like this game anymore! switch the game up! :(
@protonjon so it’s not a play to win version??
oh
🤔 hmm
the only time i really played clue was in german class in high school
mr. body is protonchugga kappa
@ogrimmar45678 a asshole who earned it.
is orchid dlc or no
the mobile version of clue is like $3

i just checked the store its 11.99
mobile version is like $2 american.
i like how green is standing up on the theater
we play one game, and then go to the cookie.
a lute, the best murder weapon.
like how far down did he have to reach?
yea, phone is $2 us
or $1.99 on the google play store
@protonjon mobile is 2 or 3 amercian
mobile is a lot cheaper
13.49 cdn
@protonjon clue league like bomberman act zero?
"i'm not one for cosmetics." so you're not wearing makeup, got it. kappa
$12. i know because i just got the game myself.
how can a lute kill someone?????
at least this looks more interedting than monopoly
how much on ios??
also, the lute.
how much are the characters on the google store?
@protonjon i dunno why i keep assuming that you can only have one of each kind of card.
wouldn't a lute break before killing someone? xd
@mariokart2014 ask elan?
since you like clue so much have you tried mysterium?
@silverkazeninja really?
google play is 1.99
cheer1 cheer1
google play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.marmalade.cluedogame
@mariokart2014 first you whack him over the head, then take one of the strings and strangle him to death
@mariokart2014 you can play john dowland's "flow my tears" and dehydrate them.
killer dog
could most computers handle it?
"cheaper" if you don't count all the dlc
bang
clue for evo 2019
give me baz @protonjon
couldn't white murder someone with her dog?
yoo, i have 2 bucks free credit on play
accuse yourself turn one jon
where's the bowling ally??
ive watched your bomberman act zero thing like 5 times at least
the wolf shot the gun
what an interesting arcade residentsleeper
good dog, best friend!
why does white need a gun when she has a wolf
is there an ios version of this??
the doggo did it teary
tearu
so until she murders a man the dog just sits there
idt that the gun was used by white, it was the dog
i love it
when did white turn into haanit?
time for baz
the dog did it!
corgiderp corgiderp corgiderp corgiderp corgiderp corgiderp corgiderp
so how do you play?
@sweetlew19 yea there is.
lul
the dog's a bro
lel
@eggsofsoda and make it more obvious?
baz?
baz?
boxcars
daaaaaaamn
i hope baz shows up on cookie
@protonjon just remember: it's still anyone's game
it's so weird to see orchid and white playing together, since orchid replaced white in the most recent versions of the board game.
@sweetlew19 and its crossplatform. so moblie can play with steam and vice versa
bomberman act zero
@protonjon is there people chatter in the background? because it's kind of obnoxious
the real anyone's game is the bombs we dropped along the way.
i'm listening to the crowd in the arcade and i swear they do not sound like a typica masquarade crowd, eheh.
@protonjon never, you did this to me. wanna stop me bring back the tournament
i'd be down for a clue league
i would do that
clue tournment i am in
pier 25
i just got back, did i here something about speed running clue?
that would be nice
there are probably already clue tournaments
i want to get the mobile version now!
lul
clue league would be amazing.
so clue game at magfest when?
lul
i have chat open in a seperate window and have the stream closed
i did it
lul
i mean there are ones for monopoly
lul
welp
youre off the case, jon!
it was me, mustard
but god damn it
but how would you do a clue tournament?
i would like to do that as i never got into the duck game and baz
stop killing people jon! xd
@kidd_decibel nice, i like that cuz i don’t have a functioning computer at the moment, thank you
lul
jon's killing everyone!
lul
he gets results
im so guilty
wait how do you kill someone with a lute? because that was a weapon option.
jon why do you keep murdering?
not the candelabra
choose a weapon: snowboard
mustard was the phantom of the opera!!!!!!!!!
my headcanon is that you accuse yourself of murder, and you're right, you manage to get away with it scot-free.
jon no! stop killing everyone
jon's bloodlust can't be sated
you're off the case bobrovsky!
for some reason, i expected cluedo to be played.
he's still the prime suspect
nvm that was a chandler
@togeyosh i mean, have you ever been to a masquerade ball in an arcade?
protonjon gets judy hopps?
wait a chandelier?
the rookie is kermit
it's 1:45 am i make mistakes
meeennnndooooozzzaaaaa!!!!!
clue is $3.99 usd on the ios app store. twice the price of google play. :/
that would be messy
ace attorney clue?
they're all prime suspects.
@mcjohnson88 only you, me, and like 5 other people are gonna get that reference. :p
i'm not out of order, you're out of order! the system is out of order! the slushie machine is out of order!
is plum beetlejuice?
?
colonel mustard, on the mountain, with the snowboard!

buymybook
i am willing to bet jon did it. the reson i believe it is jon is streamer curse
lul
he can't take me off the case if i take his life octo200iq
i've cracked the case!!! i'm the murderer!!!!!!!! book me guys!!!
#buymybook
are all the cards dealt out?
fire medz myohelraven
mendoza!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
prchase prchase prchase prchase
so it's either the pistol, poison, or parasol... how pretty.
ooooh
fired
dayum it if only were that easy kappa
well, i'm fired too
mtthh
ooooh
what if you get the murder? :p
i said that 5 minutes agaon jon
@protonjon what if you get a first turn guess though?
hmm
noice! pogchamp
what happens when the spectator eventually wins?
what if you accidentally get the right answer?
ooo
nice gallery
@protonjon but what if you get it on the first turn?
ok but what if you guess right
they have a chance to instant win though
montaru, too
lul
@protonjon what if you try to kill yourself with final accusation and get it right? :d
@protonjon and if you get the turn one guess?
cluesogrande
@protonjon yeah but what if you got the answer right?
tearu
@protonjon except the one time you get it right kappa
with your luck jon, in the process you'll somehow ending up guessing the right answer
if you get it right you celebrate
clunk
spectator could just make sure they use the cards they have in their guess i assume
i'd join... if i owned the game
the dog did it again!
you could accuse your own cards...
kaboooong! minikis
draw win
just choose the cards you have in your hand lol
i got it on first turn before
@protonjon are you gonna do another round after this?
spectator wins
farewell everyone i had a good run
than you mulligan
@protonjon quick question: do we need to be a sub to submit a egg for sub dropping? o-o
it's easy: he gueses his hand kappa
gallery is out
@protonjon just make sure your guess includes at least one of the cards you have. then it can''t be right.
ccznen naw that's too easy :d
didn't happen
well, at least let me get clue before you start this clue tournament.
how do you kill someone with a lute protonwhat protonwhat protonwhat protonwhat protonwhat protonwhat protonwhat
@protonjon we just did a clue round. it was mustard with the candlestick in the library.
but if you only have weapons?
aww
that be impossible, just guess one of the cards you start with
@ozzyman314 you murder them teabuns
you hit them with it
@ozzyman314 hit them over the head really, really hard repeatedly
@ozzyman314 blunt force trauma
@ozzyman314 you hit them with it.
@ozzyman314 hit them very hard.
@ozzyman314 bash them on the head. hard.
its a blunt object ozzyman314 it wouldn't be that hard
clue plus twitter
@h2ohappydude no, there's a public dropbox link
lutes are very sturdy?
was it actually jon again?
gotta get another cookie or two in tonight still.
bash, bash, bash, bash his head in with my instrument~!
lul
lul
you play the brown note to kill someone
lul
lul
:d
el kabong
you spoony bard
guys, a lute could be a weapon if you play styx
oh heck..thanks paperstar
lul
lul
lul
@protonjon i was the mustard i question lul
you make like el kabong and slam the lute on them.
lutes have high magic, just her elfire
perform so badly that it kills them.
first you find the lute, then the warrant
hello
practice it
i'd believe it
klong
youd think the lute would break
lul
and then lute explodes
anything can kill u!
hey guys i found the bard
lute is actually french for wrestling. someone just got chokeslammed to death.
use a lute string as a garotte wire
it was all emile
i am willing to bet jon did it. the reason i believe it is jon is streamer curse @protonjon
that or cut a string and garrote someone
blunt force trauma is very effective
@protonjon what if it gets put back on the cookie?
beat, beat, beat the guy over the heeead~
sing this song: squidward is my best friend in the world
bards will bash a motherfucker
what games did i miss
mocking words of course
@protonjon take off the strings and strangle them
you serenade them and while their guard is down you smash them
@ozzyman314 either blunt force or with the chords
you fill the lute with bricks problem solved kappa
rip dan,
d a n
@dantheenigma slapnuts with a lute
i basically said the same thing jon said.
as a bard i can confirm atleast 5 lute kills
ka-bonggg!
@protonjon there is a weapon in monster hunter called the hunting horn... that's how you cill people with a lute
that sounds like a terrible use of a bard's lute.
i have a feeling if wow ever does a bard class, they'll make it like etc in heroes of the storm. basically a heavy metal god. \m/
i mean, strangling them with the strings maybe?
til
myohelraven
hit very hard
i didn't know about that rule. :o
naw dudes. ya put c4 in the lute
@protonjon you sing nickelback songs. that's how you kill someone kappa
clue night
the 3 rules of bards: 1) sing every song. 2) kill everything with charisma. 3) lay everything. every. thing.
babyrage babyrage babyrage kappa
nitroglycerin lute
lute-on: apply directly to the forehead
i'm pretty sure you just blame them on breaking the lute and watch as the lute owner rips them to pieces
and then it becomes a mercy kill.
there are rules? kappa
how often does the mod choice win anyhow?
by the way, i noticed the rule about editing wikipedia pages? what's the story behind that one?
dan gonna pull a jeff jarrett/elias with that lute
why is clue 3/10 of a gigabyte
what if you just jam so hard they have to give up their life as payment?
i just think killing someone with a lute as a suggestion is hilarious. lul
clue is good
@protonjon , can you explain the clipboard?
oh well.
uh oh
hello
ooooh
huh...
ah, i know that feel of being distracted by games. i'm playing isaac right now, and i keep surprising myself with how quickly time flies
@deltaphoxtrot hey, all that dlc's gotta go somewhere.
how about that?
hmmmmmm
@kinkyray no you're going the wrong way fill the lute with spikes and hurl it as hard as you can at soemeone
so does this mean...?
i think we got a gun
@protonjon i'd be down for the rest of the stream being clue
they could've picked their own cards
guess we got our case.
okay then
um...
i like how you can't suggest the hallway as a posible location.
those are totally all their cards
@metalvictini = the d. bomberman act zero. good luck. :)
so... gg?
ja'cuse!
wow
huh... taki! how could you!?
i didn't think so.
huh...
oh. never mind
jon with the parasol on the pier. got it kappa
like what does the check mean?
@togeyosh it means the person who suggested really wanted to narrow down one of the categories.
wish one of the dlcs was of the movie characters but that would be expensive...
do igt
i want clue
intrusting
:p
i dont mind clue
not me.
@protonjon have wednesdays dedicated clue nights?
not me
@heart_man_24 same here.
do it.
just game clear clue
people can make fake-outs, as well
@brewsky93 interesting! th-though i'm not sure why or how.
this is really chill so i've just had the stream on in the background anyway lol circomfy
but jon, you need to do gunstar heroes streams on wednesdays now myohelraven
yeah clue bores me
that would break so many times
snickersboom snickersgoal
i have the feeling jon is the murder yet again lol
after all these clue streams and jon explaining the game like five times i still don't understand what's happening notlikethis
in fact 50% of the people here didn't like clue if the poll was to be believed.
monday stream being clue...would that be like your bach party?
murica
fuck yeah
clue is not for everyone
fuck yeah
i'd be cool with dedicated clue streams. it makes for good background noise :)
fuck yeah!
fuck yeah!
fuck yeah
fuck yeah
me too
@togeyosh usually when that happens, they're very close to winning.
idk i really enjoy watching you blame yourself for murder
fuck yea
fuck yeah
fuck yeah
clue fuck yeah
fuck yeah
i've been in and out, but let's say that jon suggested orchid, sword and gallery, if one opponent has all 3 does that player show all 3 or just 1? o_o

@protonjon would you do a sub night with jackbox party 5 when it releases?
fuck it
mr green loves his parasol
how is a parasol a weapon?
scream?
@protonjon but isn't that halloween related? it's spooky and people are wearing facepaint
@protonjon @boodamedz @dantheenigma to be fair, all clue night is probably the only thing that could beat high risk cookie on the wednesday poll. :p
how about the nightmare before christmas for next movie night then?
mrdestructoid\
jon, what is the spooky game for this year?
when is the wedding scheduled? i've forgotten
@protonjon tattooed teenage alien fighters seemed _scarily_ bad, that counts as halloween-y right? kappa

gasp
oh boy...
okay taki
j'accuse
dear chat, i'll never get over the faces the characters make for the final accusation.
well i mean, a power rangers knockoff would be scary enough for a halloween stream.
"i've got it!"
nani!?
@kinkyray superman 64 protonwesk
@mariokart2014 = ask edna from zestiria. ;)
so excited
of course the doctor would know...
taki is known for taking chances
this is the truth of the case

mustard, posion, in ballroom is my guess
taki was wrong oops

dammit david tennant

so they are dead now?
green is gone
fired
you guessed wrong! now you die!
and green is sentenced to eternal facepalming.
green tried to blame himself but failed
taki
ya done goofed taki
"wait, it wasn't me?!"
you are off the case!
"you suck. we don't trust you anymore."
"dang it you can't even frame yourself right!"
so what happens if everybody's wrong?
@protonjon that was taki
sit in the quarter green you fucked up
taki was green.
"i screwed up! they think i'm a fraud..."
wow
taki wasn't it?
ultaki?
taki
utaki
they get sent to the corner
leave your evidence here. you're off the case
taki's always mr. green
taki's out.
darkfire is orchid
taki
taki
no one, but i know they were handsome @protonjon pattybongo
@ultaki inb4 you're stripped of your modship. kappa
it was taki
rip taki
taki was green*
poor taki you tried
that was taki. darkfire is orchid.
@protonjon welp, i just lost a game to ai
this is what happens in danganronpa after you lose too much life
taku was executed
@topazshot88 then no one wins!!! :d
"yes i'm innocent wait fuck"
green you can't just accuse yourself for attention, thats a faux pas
lul
yep
oh man, look at green's portrait!
he said noooo in chat
@mastertimethief *slow claps*
"i did it! but i forgot where i was when i did it..."
why did he accuse himself?
clue
taki committed sudoku. keepo
taki :d
the8bitb
you can technically accuse youtself in the game
mr. green was dragged off for monokuma's execution
:d
welp, i lost my first game. :p
@tsgjamesr put 2 8s in the same lien kappa
but it wasnt green
@alan_m00ch being the murderer has no effect on the outcome of the game.
ultaki
do you get a partial flip if one of the cards was right or...?
i have a guess on the combo
"i really thought i did it! i have memories of doing it! protonthump "
"did i kill this guy...?"
taki go to corner and think about what you did wrong
he may of had amnesia
the point of clue is to get it right, not to get away with it.
@taganplaysstuff you can suggest what has already been ruled out so you can rule out other categories.
i got a guess from jon's clues...
question: how can you possibly not tell whether someone died of poison or being shot?
he drank too much last night and was all like "my god! what have i done!?"
he may be right, he may be crazy
d:
bukdc
what
j'accuse?
i confess to a crime i did not commit!!!
oh boy
d:
oh?
i accuse myself! crap i was wrong!
um?
oh god
d:
darkfire?
wha?
oh shit
the plot thickens
:o
i have sufficient evidence to suggest i was the murderer!
@caliatom the losing player sees what the cards were
pogonawut pogonawut pogonawut pogonawut pogonawut pogonawut pogonawut pogonawut pogonawut
oh?
oh....
nani
again?
o_o
dammit
"i know who the killer is!"
oh!?
j'accuse!
basically it's a who-dun-it where everybody is an expert detective but also amnesiac.
excuse me?
d: gasp!
time for darkfire
j'accuse
oh my >.>
"i was trying to kill myself... and missed..."
ooh boy
oh snap, wasn't expecting that!
another accusation!!
closing argument! climax inference!
eh!? j'accuse!

darkfire's out.
goodbye orchid
well she doesn't have the gallery then?
you fool
another one bites the dust
called it.
double facepalm
protonsad
@pokerjoker811 if it's a really good poison or a really small but effective bullet
more eternal facepalming
the murderer had a black out when they murdered them
f
this is the truth of the case- oh
so im guessing green with the parasol but where
go join green orchid
and then there were 4
another one down
another execution
also fooooooooool!!
that's two out! two people facepalm!
@protonjon i was the killer, i guessed the killer and the weapon, but the ai was after me and it took the location no one had. so ai wins.
rip darkfire
you're off the case nancy drew
and then orchid had a stroke
i'm telling ya it's mustahd!
you may be right. i may be crazy...
everyone is dying lul
four?
[facepalm]
another one gone. get the oompah loompahs!!
no that's wrong!
@darkfireyoshi did you misclick too?
*cue monokuma laughing in the background*
well then, this is getting interesting
mutant snake eyes
let's give it everything we got...it's punishment time!!!!
what happens if everyone is eliminated?
also rip dice
is this the x-files game trying to arrest random civilians
someone give orchid some damn asprin!
no i had a 50/50 gues
*guess
wait, what did i miss?
wheres the 3rd dice kappa
sore wa chigaiyo
is it possible for everyone to lose?
@protonjon is it considered a win or a stalemate if everyone but one person somehow guesses wrong?
so does this mean you get more coins or am i thinking of the wrong game?
murder in the bedroom.
@explodingtittysyndrome what's the matter with you?
this map has a pier on it.
does the game end if one person is left after everyone else guesses wrong, or can you make a draw by everyone being wrong?
this should be game
so it' green
@jarr2003 then no one wins...but if you're the last one left, you have all the time you need....
is he beating him with the poison bottle
cool kids blame green
sucy would be proud
aha...
makes sense
gonna risk it for the trisket?
!uptime
protonjon has been streaming for: 3 hours 30 minutes 37 seconds
don't
but no poison...
mr. body wanted to get drunk. instead he got death
mtthh
its mustard
oh, wasn't expecting that
poison is for chumps the container on the other hand
i got another guess put me in!
definitely green tho
lmao ever since that one accusation from white people have been hounding on green
i've so got this
what if everyone but one makes wrong accusations?
not risking it? but this is clue
if you don't like your guess, don't risk it.
where's prince?????
green with the parasol at the pier
mad plum
in the selection screen
mustard parasol pier is my guess
@ultaki nope you had your chance, now you have to wait on the bench
if you get another chance
the odds aren't in favor to guess...
i have a feeling dan is going to go for it here....
green with green at the green
but so does everyone else
idk y i miss read dantheenigma as thanos idk how but im tired
here we go

lobster facts: lobsters are technically immortal. they only die naturally when they don't have the energy to keep growing and molting, which means many old lobsters die from lack of energy available through food or because they get crushed in their own shell that they can't escape from. this has been lobster facts.

the talons help catch them, but the sharp beak breaks through the shell like nothing else.
i tried sushi one time, didnt like it
after you steam the crab, you use heavy duty scissors to cut the shell, its leathery at that point
piestreambiger piestreambiger piestreambiger piestreambiger piestreambiger piestreambiger
from there, just sluuuuurp
if you steam claw tho, the scissors might break

no joke, like three people tweeted ray’s tweet at me right when he posted it
how long til the divorce?
like v bucks
my favorite joke that tina makes is asking him when he will propose to her. now the joke is dead. :(
just like she ate our hearts browncharlie brownheart
i just bought ur brown man bracelet can't wait
@deltajford understatement of the year
where would y’all go for your honeymoon

is charlie gonna be the ring bearer?
@harveyw97 pls lul
so you're telling me that ray went out all on his lonesome and bought a ring kylieomg
it's almost like healthy relationships discuss big plans brownthink
needed a month to work up the courage because ray is socially awkward?
did ray know the ringsize beforehand?

hi ray, tina and chat
do you guys have a mailbox we can send wedding gifts to?
his sell out bag must be light
well of course, you need to figure out what gift each of you get to keep lol
he bought the ring on craigslist
the wedding gifts are gonna be body pillows
he used twitch prime + robucks
woo wish!
are you going to chucky cheese for a honey moon or something lame like paris or disney @brownman
*at a ring shop* do you accept bitcoin
nah ray spent the last 6 year's opening lootboxes for the ring
oh thats smart
2$ shipping tinastress
it was a ring pop fyi kappaclaus
thought ray gonna proposed on stream
tina threatened to ruin his gamerscore if he didnt get her ring size
oh okay that works too
if you two get divorced (god forbid), does tina get half of chat?
tina and ray "all right we got the presents marriage over peace"
.....this is brilliant. you said wish?
engagement rings are expensive as fuck
brb
can you stream the divorce brownjokes
lmao kevin
when is the wedding happening? piethink
that is very clever
that's a really good idea!
what was the color, cut and clarity?
that's... awesome.
thats actually really fucking smart
$5 instead
nah!!! $2 is toooo much shipping
she added 4 zeros
and they made it $4 wesmart
that's a great fucking idea
bullshit. if they can make it for $3 then it's a steal
so the ring was $4?
if he then just used that for the proposal would you have still said yes?
not $3? how about $4?
two bucks that is two much
but where ray ring
a ring pop works too
noted rooisee
wearevenom fbcatch
that is really smart actually
that is such a good idea
@espressocrow so are you about to do that to sunny
next time, ring pop
lul
can you make this but not out of plastic
brownkiss brownkiss brownkiss
2.50 is the best i can do
cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 cheer100 congratulations
@deeannachu damn straight
ray actually just has a blacksmith friend who forged the ring kappa
would y'all stream the wedding or is that too weird?

thats probably better tbh too many people rush shit
browntina
everything in its own time, right?
every relationship is different
marriage is something you get to at your time. no one can say anything lol
thats what matters
marriage doesn't mean the same thing to every couple anyway.
i hate that there's a "pace" to marriage. fuck society. it's 100% personal
no rush, i know some people who got married really soon after first meeting, and my brother's been with his gf or 11 years and is in no rush to get married, whatever works
hey, saw the tweet. congratulations!!!
get that guy outta here
every couple has their own journey. no one relationship is the same.
you two are so sweet together, congratulations <3 <3
really, 4-5 years is fine imo
auto focus, knock it off
4 years? thats an american thing. in germany you get married after like 5-10 years.

relationships are very personal, when others are ready or think its right is nothing to do with you and saying finally makes me feel weird
you can’t rush a relationship
go on your pace. fuck what is conventional.

hey ray! getting to watch your stream while at work. cheers from dunkin donuts! @brownman
@deltajford yeah, everyone thought the three stooges movie made him famous kappa
out of your pepehands
why us customs a thing brownfeels
that is on their customs office, hold ups in customs will take the same time regardless
is
ugh, i have an online store and dealing with shipping is the worst
btw, the merch store site is 100/100
it really sucks in the uk because it's a £11 handling fee just to get it from customs
!store in case you were wondering what ray and tina are talking about brownsellout
i could use a money tree
customs is based on the value of the package so it gets pretty ew
would happen literally every time in the uk as far as i've seen - we have strict/expensive import laws
customs in the uk is just a roulette of nonsense
oh shit its w33d g0d!
browntina
where does one get a money tree
customs agent "whats this brownman pillow"
yeah depends on country as some make extra for customs
merch website is awesome seriously kudos to tina.
you need money seeds to grow a money tree
:::>
customs in the uk is literally random
it is at random
knowing my luck, customs is gonna fuck me over
there's nothing you can do about it - customs do random checks
browntina browntina browntina browntina brownkiss brownkiss brownkiss
so customs in the uk is supposed to be for everything over a certain value but you whether they catch it is really random
happ for your engagement
moon2ph when your order is in an indie games
germany customs is the rougheest
british customs is very random
*an indie game
in the uk it's only from a certain amount but most of the time they don't care
ive paid customs on a $20 order but not on a $100 order
kevin plz brownlul
an indie games is better kevin
fifiw whaddup
i don't think it's random cause everytime i ordered from rooster teeth us store i always have customs
it depends on the country is going to
brownhey cynth
hey cynthia!
if people in eu order something outside of eu their shit would get stuck in customs depending on the value of the package browncry
hi cynth
i can buy 5 tshirts from 5 shops and only 2/5 will get checked
how did the proposal happen?
oh no ray

wrong as in they snipsniped the wrong thing
sup patrick!
so you're not going to adopt anymore dogs kappa
kids browns browns
kids are fucking assholes
browncharlie
it means the vasectomy wasnt succesful
but it could be a literal twitch baby! tina just has to stay subbed for 9 months brownjokes
ray how long until people ask when are you going to have grandkids, i get asked that now and i'm 19 and single
chat is the step-child that ray didn't want
you two have a daughter tho? charlie?
kids? yuck! wheat? poggers
get charlie a girlfriend!!
what’s tina’s stream situation?
oh damn my 1 year crown
ray having a kid is something the devil sends to signify the apocalypse
it looks and sounds gross ngl
starting from sex
especally the beginning
yeah sex is gross
when a twitch baby becomes a tomagahci
eww sex
gross
girls are gross. they have cooties.
what would you name your kid?
sex
same tina same
jr jr?
i mean, making is kids pretty cool
the sex part is so gross
100% with you tina
i feel the same way, pregnancy is gross
tina isnt my mom?
forcing a kid out of you
having sex dansgame
imagine liking sex???? like grossssss
im lowkey so into the idea of being pregnanct but everything from labour on seems nasty and i want no part
you gave me pizza money last night like a mom
pregnancy is a horrifying concept to me tbh
c section all they way
!store
giving birth is the grossest thing i can think of
says she's mom like right after telling a story of her getting smashed and asking ray what his dads name
kappa
tina i had to watch a film in my film class where its like a woman giving birth and i wanted to die jamie24stan jamie24stan jamie24stan
like a parasite in you
the making part is great the having part is not the best
sounds like you need to adopt a kid
ya like sex ew gross
what about adoption?
the worst part of pregnancy is the sex browncringe
you could adopt a kid
no thx
i made a box fort. it was very fun
name the kid tina narvaez iv
my nephews (6 and 3) have been living with me for months since i got home from the hospital and it is an absolute nightmare.
my mom loves the wine
lul fair enough
"we're going to dinner, dont starve"
drinkin for 2 lmao
ur right star turtle
moms drink the most
moms become moms because they get smashed
seems is an understatement
im adopted
i was wrong
i actually love making the boxes
you give up your life for a kid. a noose works better kappa
mom's get smashed? that's how they become moms in the first place.
brownweeb
i just noticed what the green schreen does to rays shirt.
browncheer1000 browncheer100 congrats on the engagement mom and dad keepo ! really though i hope you two the happiest of lives together!
you could say that it's an ad-option
adopt all of us
@tinadayton moms drink because there a mom
instead of kids just get another charlie browncharlie browncharlie browncharlie
leslie that wasnt a pun moon2plsno
this is how unexpectant pregnancies happen
i might need to adopt because its been like 89 years since i banged
@wafflecans get out
woah smashing moms charilewd
kids are not for everyone
yo, the baby's first words can be "you are my dad! boogie woogie woogie"
i feel like if you guys ever consider having kids it'd be years later
like the giving birth part is horrifying but also what your body goes through during pregnancy is horrifying
ray looks suspicious as fuck right now lul
ohhhhhh
for real tho can i get a vasectomy at 19
i aspire to be like the fastest box maker for dominos
lmao
i can see myself being a surrogate mom lol
that's what fur babies are for
awww thats cute
oh thats pretty cool
y'all are too busy for a child honestly.
lol ray's face
ray's face right now xp
kevin ur right tinastress
that'd be cool
brownlul
that'd be cool if you all do that some day
that's very sweet
are you say you got a a-bor-tion mrdestructoid
that’s a perfectly fair and reasonable reason to not adopt
@brownman you need to play skyrim up till you can get married for that achievement
hosting international students is the best

my wife asked me about hosting a foreign exchange student. i said "not if our kids are in high school"

charlie stuff would be great
i'm a sucker for the galaxy crown, but i know that is probably difficult
browncharlie snapback
you should do like a wedding sticker
a brown crown and tt logo snapback as an engagement special
another dad hat with the brown crown. those are the hats i wear
@doomegg nah they dont
a russian ushanka, but with a fr or bc logo
a green hat that has weedgod on it

ray have you ever been gnomed?
thats some good canoli
do a dad hat with the puerto rican flag
roonom brownhey
puerto rican flag but instead of the star its the brown crown
brown bucket hat would do bits in the uk
i kinda like the idea having an emote on a hat, like one that’s really popular. like brownhey
what about a dab snapback?
could we have fedora hat that says "m'brownman"
a cartoon ray doing finger pistols saying jokes
@erocksnips damn was just about to say that
have the backseat emote on a hat bc i love that emote with my whole soul
can i get a brownman lunchbox?
hell yeah
wait you say i can ask for underwear merch kappa
buying one of each
when are you bringing slap bracelets to the store?
@tinadayton will they all be flat bills or will there be baseball style
i wear my foil shirt like once a year
@brownman r u all doing extra lift

i think a w33dgod!!! plush or line of stuff would be good
id wear a flat black beanie with the browncrown without the rim i guess youd call it @tinadayton
what spencer said
is a rainbow shirt an option. as in the full shirt is rainbow colored with a crown on it
wait 10 years they'll come up with the tech @fudoprime
or if you put the year on the repeating shirts, the ones without the year part are retroactively still the rare version
it's kind of simple but what if there was just a hat that says "cool." like in a stardew font or something
browngold snapback?
a hat with the subtrain logo. be apart of the sub train irl
ooo yeah some w33dgod merch would be cool lol
the subtrain logo is a good shout

thankfully i bought mine when i could
i super wanted a purple zip up hoodie too
i want one of those purple hoodies, they look really comfortable
another item you could sell in your store @brownman is a backpack so i have a place to store all my weed brownjokes

good problem to have
thats almost enough for 2000 orders
managed to sneak in a xs hoodie purchase
@skylerthacreator yeah and backpack
let's be honest, i only bought the achievements and chill shirt for the business card
if it's worth doing, do it well
you're really on the ball with it, it really shows with how much you care about the store
have you thought about doing a reusable grocery bag. people use 'em.
is the farm named ram ranch, and if not, why not?
why not put the emotes on the shirts too. for each season too.
eat the shirts
what are you playing this on?
brown dib dab and its coca cola flavoured
why.... why would you eat the stock?
brownman pop sockets?????
easy solution, edible underpants.
are controller's possible?
oh yeah nvm
the og brown crown shirt is a classic
when's the brownman underwear

ooo that'd be cute
blankets could also be a good shout, i own like 20 blankets
sellout or streamer popsockets poggers
omg thats cute
browndoggers the only charlie design you need
oh! how about a pixelized brown crown?

i live at 15 yemen road, yemen
limesblank
wtf y'all are dumb
not knowing your own address? dansgame
jamie @ shirt: how does getting bought make you feel?
seriously how do people,not know where they live
how can you not know your own address like........yall okay
you need a customer service professional.
this happens a lot in customer service
oh god
wtf
i feel this on a molecular level
a
afro can do customer service kappa
perhaps it would help if those people would write their fucking addresses correctly
how!?
uk hould be easy we all live in downton abbey, abbey road or buckingham palace
i live here, send stuff to me @ here
how do you fuck that up!?
but like
i'm always scared i'm gonna mispell my address so i triple check everytime
you’re inventory. :/
just use a nuclear localization signal sequence @pixelatedneon
i live in canada is is that @ there spencer?
your*
the dog has mad hops jumping over the hedges like that
^^^* zelder
tl;dr people are dumb
i remember memorizing my address as a kid because i was scared i would need it for emergencies lol.
ive had 3 addresses in the last 12 months and have never fucked my address up when ordering
i enter my address as "up your but and around the corner" one time and they both throw a fit about it
@zelderfreak lol same
but
kevin no
kevin lul
can you deliver this shirt to the trash can under the bridge on highway 16.
jamie you gonna finish that statement
only once, kevin?
ray (or tina), what were you gonna do for the game mats?
kevin tinagiggle
@musabshuaib honestly, i would lmao
@unbakedstorm they were just mad because you called their bluff and tried to get it where you shipped it to
@westminsterabbey you're one of the most well known addresses ever how do you forget?
poggers
oh okay, badass. i think that's a great idea!
it's gonna have a giant picture of kaiba vs yugi on it
the game mat is actually just the browncrown printed on paper
so the afro community kappa
i dont need to know my address, google autofill has my back
i use a game mat as my dice mat for d&d :)
jade pls
just do waifu pillow, that covers all of that
i will totally buy onne though
zelder also you right
get my match attacx
deck box could hold dice and small snacks as well.
@ktyna same...thank god for autofill

brownboo brownheart brownyay brownheart brownboo
can i put the game mat on motorcycles kappa
autofill maybe
good ole autofill

kansas and texas are like the same address right kappa
@joe_skywalker yo i'm 928 years old, i forget things.
4 privet drive jamie24keepo
tina i think it has to do a lot with google's auto fill feature
i am paranoid -every time- entering my address. i check and recheck it probably three times and still think it's wrong...
auto fill isn’t always nice
okay so can we get like, deck boxes or nah
kappa
@westminsterabbey are you the doctor
oh, i still do
moon2ph when its send to edamamehvoid

damn you bugs!!!!! cohhold
they have less than 2 weeks , it's ok cohhk
@cohhcarnage weird bug with camera angle makes you run faster ?
about 50
@cohhcarnage lets do it vice versa, whats the worst game of the year so far?
!time
cohhcarnage's time is currently 8:38 am est
@szympion89 you can but it resets everytime you fast travel or reload the game
it's tight @cohhcarnage ... no1kyaa
makes you think, didn't they test it before release?
gimme elder scrolls 6! ;p
barbie house is cohh`s goty cohhlul cohhlul cohhlul cohhlul
bethesda fixing anything lul
it doesn't work properly, yeah
it works, but it makes the game unstable
fov??
console fov wutface
@cohhcarnage fixing fov is ini based, i had to do ini changes to get ultrawide working, what freaking aaa game in 2018 doesn't support ultrawide?!?!
cohhcarnage there is so many tapes around, if you want to listen to most you have to stop and sit around alot :p
relax, they have 10 days to go, why shouldn't they fix the things they had time since 2015 for in this time?
ui is tied to fov i think
chaning the fov makes you run faster
it works, but if you open the map then it goes back to default
fov
if you fast travel it resets the fov
ultrawide doesn't work either danbad
teclado92 you can just tag him in chat, but a lot of people here so it's hard for him to catch everything

you cant mod fo76 dano
multiplayer games needs constant patches so hoping fo76 do the same
fov????????????????????????????????

@cohhcarnage if you uncap fps in ini file you can run faster kappa typical bethesda game
u can not
!time
bahroo was playing yesterday, and was reseting all the time
@hiryuunoshi field of view
how about unlocking the framerate lul
@pixelmain field of view
strange, considering you can easily change the fov in fallout 4
you have to change it in the game folder, not the documents folder.
if you change it in the ini it pushed the ui off the screen
omfdwa i know right? just chill
good morning cohh!!! hello chat
the ui is tied to the fov so....
fallout 74 lul
@cohhcarnage it works but it resets if you die or quick travel
@cohhcarnage it feels like fallout 76 was a console port to pc the way the ui and everything feels
omfdwa lul
nexusmod to the rescue
ini edit it works... until you use vats or fast travel
@cohhcarnage you need to make a fallout76custom . ini in your documents and add the fov in there; vats does break the fov back down though
@ulukator cohh loves interacting with chat & viewers, so please try to keep conversations in english! thanks for understanding cohhgg

@cohhcarnage if you tweak the fov of fallout 76 in config files ui elements end up off screen apparantly :(
i’m all for bethesda trying something new, still wish it was fallout 5 instead though.
there are some really strange mechanics in the fallout engine. for exmaple the pipboy color and light intensity is tied to the flashlight for some reason.

todays not the last time you can play beta @cohhcarnage
i still havent seen actual basebuilding, its the thing that will make or break it for me
!subs
@egergames what? i made thousands via poker in rdr1 pretty early on.
@cohhcarnage do you have any plans on playing any co - op games with subs in the future?
holotips danuh
!quote
new engine?
betas for fixing things xd
@aghamyr there are specific areas u can capture that are bigger and offer a huge space
i wish my beta went as smoothly
i mean... there's def some lil kinks to work out.... fps drop in towns is one. push to talk another. for sure.
@cohhcarnage did you know bethesda gave all the beta users 3 codes to invite friends to the fallout 76 beta?
in 2 weeks cohhderp
ai sucks too
cohhhi beararsed
push-to-talk and fov cohhbless
they also need to fix the budget for bases
1st person party
but overall it was the feeling.
how many chapters are there in total in the game?
!baby
ghost players talking after you close the game? :d
they need to completely redo pvp
ohh you have not been in power armour have you?
imo they are too small
@cohhcarnage what about movement speed tied to fps?
bethesda fixing things dankek
push to talk? thats hard to fix kappa
skip again
you can set the fov in ini file
the pvp is the biggest issue for me, either it's unrestricted or i won't buy it
whats wrong with the pvp
last one is design decision not gonna happen
is pvp forced? or are there pve servers where you and your base is safe?
!time
cohhcarnage's time is currently 9:19 am est
better game engine
by pvp changes do you mean actually allow pvp?
boop
@cohhcarnage it's common for betas to increase spawn rates on both enemies and items so we'll have to wait for launch
yep
oh wow was pvp a problem for you @cohhcarnage ? i didnt have any problems with it
angry cohhboys kappa
aradim not happening.
i'm sorry, when is the 100% fallout playthrough?
@desarlion i never gambled so yeah...it's against my nature
separate servers with not fake pvp
more than 4 people in a team would be nice as well
i am feeling stabby again!! cohhcrazy cohhknife
he's a dick, period cohhrude
@cohhcarnage what about speed hack?
they might want to fix the moddability as well. someone already changed a bunch of things in the game with fo4 modding tools
@cohhcarnage well you just mentioned like 80% of the game...
you forgot the horrible controls and how obvious of a port it is
is he a dick to himself?
i'm still puzzled that any game company would make a multiplayer without push-to-talk
yes
cohhtos
@cohhcarnage how would you make game like 76 without loot respawning?
lol 76 sucks so much of course it by bethseda
still dunno about the no npcs and only holotapes for lore thing going on in 76
cohh they should also remove water drinking animation and sort out the items you can sit on when you loot something on them
let pple choose pvp or pve could be an option.
there's a lot to listen to here
cohh hi all
rooree load
roowut cohhknife it's blunt
aradim most will put on pacifist mode at lvl 5 , and play it as a singel player
is he at the italian
i had a blast with 76
so what you are saying is.. besides everything, it is a great game kappa lul
cohhhi
i spent an hour trying to do the platform challange in the wood without any success...i loved it
!quote
" good luck friend! <quest failed" - cohh
then without pvp it's just fallout 4 with no mods
go to the food table first
if you are in power armor and you are over your normal weight limit but under the power armor weight limit you will get a "you are over encumbered" when you die and not be able to respawn near death
@lilfighterjet its not? so pvp is forced?
@cohh have u tried basebuilding in 76 or what can u tell about it
nah he loves himself
is console and pc gonna be mixed together ? anyone knowns (fallout 76)
@kevinsr1969 cohhboop
aradim the most you can hope for is full on survival pvp servers 1 year afte release when they add private servers / mods.
@cohhcarnage hello man how you doin ? cohhl cohhl cohhl
looot respawn
entire story told with just holotapes now thats just lazy tbh
you have to respawn at vault
@cohhcarnage have you checked out the stable in saint denis? good horses for sale there
@luna_is_bestprincess roowut 🗡️
fix the quest list. remove 'drive by' quests, uncap the fps, oh there is a ton of stiff that needs to be fixed to even consider droping $60 dollars on a 10 year old buggy as hell engine.
!bttv
for a browser plugin to make the channel chat better, go to http://www.betterttv.com/ this is what cohh uses to highlight/blacklist things in twitch chat. for a personal sub only chat type /localsub and to exit type /localsuboff
im glad i didnt pre order fallout 76, its crap!
@cohhcarnage they also need to fix al ot animations, it happens from time to time that enemies don't have an attack animation or are just permanent in t-pose mode
idc fallout i only care elder scrolls
??????
oh yes... that loot issue is weird.
i mean dont you need to make it client sided then
what about movement speed tied to fps in 76? @cohhcarnage
@cohhcarnage yes because everyone needs to get them
cohhnani
@bassoon_beast from 2pm to 7pm cohhst cohhderp
enclasethink
ghosts cohhm
cohhfail
@cohhcarnage how do you feel the whole "every live person you meet is a human" thing is going to work out? is the lack of npcs bothering you at all?
robots refill
@cohhcarnage aaaaaaaa... so they should disable respawns for certain items
pvpv in 76= you take almost no dmg when attacked until shooting back. however idk if you guys know this but when joining the "hunters channel" you get targets to kill(players)
enemies also respawn it seems
also the stash and weight limits are awful, you know they are going to charge you for added carry space
it's back for other players to loot?
@cohhcarnage i think thats so u always have junk to scrap with
it needs to respawn because other people need it?
its a mmo it has to respawn
not renewing toilet paper danw
@cohhcarnage its for other people
janitors need jobs @cohhcarnage
@cohhcarnage its not only you playing
it really stinks that you are rushing through this game
it has to respawn though?
yeah, multiplayer problems
whats the difference tbh?
maybe it should be a on a long timer.
@shannonzkiller yeah, it does cohhhmm
@toxikbrain it's currently flag based, and the revenge system is just weird.
the lead weights in the gym
@cohhcarnage buts in an online game...how else are other players going to be able to pick up the toilet paper?
agreed
@ddavec well people get their own loot
bronte seems like a traitor notlikethis
cohhwut
well it's a multiplayer game rooderp
it's an mmo though @cohhcarnage
it's not a single player game...
fallout in a non survival setting residentsleeper
oh wow was pvp a problem for you @cohhcarnage ? i didnt have any problems with it
@cohhcarnage then how will anyone else get it?
infinit toilet paper. nice ^^
if its a pseduo mmo its gona need the loot to respawn otherwise nobody would find shit
they need to client side item loot
respawning toiletpaper is actually pretty handy cohhcarnage cohhk
@cohhcarnage wasnt also the case in the last fallout??? remembered it happend to me several times
well if there are 16 players on server it has to respawn
morning @katiecat9 cohhblush cohhboop cohhl
curious if its possible that this loot doesnt respawn only for those who already got it
understand cuz it's multiplayer, totally takes you out of the world
hi
its a mmo if it didn't respawn it would not be there for others
lol bill in a 3 piece
cohhhi garrapartida says hi to cohh and chat.
@johnygeds he's redoing this mission for that very reason
but then you would come to a point where you cant get more resources! @cohhcarnage
thats multiplayer tho
@cohhcarnage loot containers are personal not shared loot. loot in the world is free-for-all and respawns.
how would u make a multiplayer other way?
at least a time frame for respawn
@cohhcarnage do you think it should be like account bound loot that doesnt respawn?
@cohhcarnage it's not.
no cohh.
its not
that's strange, because is not fallout 76 client side? which means you play in your own world connected to other players?
even if its a multiplayer, the item is gone.. its gone, its probably not quest items
no its not
is it the same if u destroy furniture and it fixes itself after 5 minutes?
it's not
@cohhcarnage loot containers are personal not shared loot. loot in the world is free-for-all and respawns.
cohh, if it was non spawning other players would not find it and this kind of items would be finite
its shared
how would other players get this stuff??
its not
no
world loot isnt unique
its not its all shared
shared
its not unique.
@m3rcer heresy! cohhold no loot is for others but me
yeah it'zs "instanced"
no
@lilfighterjet i just want a pve world. nobody that can bother me. then i might be slightly interested
no, its shared
its not
@cohhcarnage its shared
that's all data you have to save somewhere. i don't think bethesda wants to save hundreds of megabytes worth of loot data cohh
@cohhcarnage its not unique
@cohhcarnage it isnt unique
@psychonrails hello lovely! cohhblush cohhl
its unique tot he server you're on
cohhcrazy cohhbeer
its not client side
survival... no competition lul
open world loot is shared in box loot is not
infinite toilet paper would be pretty could though imo
no
it's like an enemy spawn
@cohhcarnage it's definitely not unique to you.
in game items is shared, containers/corpses are instanced
it is not an mmo cohhfail mmo stands for massively multiplayer. 30 players is not massive
people can take loot spawns in you're world
i have like 3 overseer journal #1s
cohhghi cohhboop katiecat9
loot is unique to a player if its in a compartment. if its out on its own tho it's shared.
imagine doing 4 fallout game on the sameish engine and still having the same problems lul
i would have to look at how the loot system is set up
only loot in containers is
!fallout76

no i heard container loot is unique but what lays around is shared
@cohhcarnage its not instanced
@cohhcarnage yes, everyone shares the same world, same stuff, hence respawn items
it is static
nope
corpse and chests are instaced.
@joku212 cohhboop vohiyo
client side
katiecat9 lady katie ! cohhcheer cohhl cohhd cohhf
no
no
some is shared some is not i dont get the system quite yet
actually the world loot is for everyone, the loot on contairners is instanced
no
nope
the rest is not
cohhhmm
@cohhcarnage in your honest opinion will they fix the game by launch
gone is gone
2 players cant pick up the same object
no
yes you do you do compete with other
unless its quest based then its also unique
no
@cohhcarnage no its gone
no
only crates
no
@cohhcarnage corpse loot is unique.
no
no man
gun is gone
its gone
open world loot is contended
@cohhcarnage only the loot from chests and mobs is player specific. open world loot is same for all
nope its gone
gone
if it's a killed enemy it is shared
cohhghi cohhboop darkresonance
only containers are client side
container loot is instanced world loot isnt
world items are one time loot
no. they have to wait some time
its gone
or was it never on their screen in the first place?
gone
@cohhcarnage dissapear
container loot is instanced world loot is shared like power armor and stuff
its all client side
you kill you loot
no cohh, world loot is shared between player so if someone picks something it disapears for the others
period
its gone
@darkresonance hello lovely cohhl cohhboop
@cohhcarnage containers and corpses are instanced per player, open loot is first come first serve until respawn
its gpone from their screen
only containers are personal
just start shooting up the party.
it will dissapear bikeman tested it yday
both can loot stuff.
world items will dissapear
no they will dissappear
no
gongon cohhcrazt
in world items are not instanced, containers/corpses are instanced
@toxikbrain yea, so an option bethesda could do is to allow the players to choose between playing a pve or pvp server.
@aghamyr vinejoel5
yes
joku212 cohhfa cohhcheer
yes
yes
static items are only good for 1 player
yes
yes
cohh, that's why that girl only got very few stuff at the end of the escort quest. you looted it all
they can pick up same gun
yes
yes
yes
yes
not shared loot.
yes
loot from chests/bodies are per person
yes
yes, answer cohhs two questions with: no gg chat lul
yes
correct
yes
true
yea
well the loot is random on the corpses for each player
you cant loot if it not yours
yes
@cohhcarnage only containers loot are personal yes
@cohhcarnage loot in the world you have to compete for, loot in containers/bodies are personal
yes
that's why it respawns per like 45 minutes
it disappears
no
everyone gets their own loot drops
bike and timmac proved it, anything on the ground is far game
yes
*gone gone gone
cohhhi cohhlurk

cohhgshow cohhgshow cohhgshow cohhgshow cohhgshow
danhmm
yep
containers and quest-based loot are client side. open world items sat on their own that aren't quest based are shared.
physical things you can see are only 1 instance
imagine how much data you would have to track per save file to know if you as a single person loots that item
streamer: "is at a or b ?" chat: "yes!"
not rlly
@lilfighterjet cant agree more
only containers are instanced
if you unlock a safe, its personal loot. if you find a special gun on the table thats in the world. only 1 person can pick it up and you need to wait for it to respawn.
@cohhcarnage some items are instanced and some aren't. e.g. only 1 player in party can pick up found bobblehead and they spawn in open world
no
loot should definitely be per player nad not re spawn like that
you mean bad?
cohh items in the world are gone gone the items looted off of containers are personal
entire f76 is a weird decision lul
as it should, right? one drop, one pickup. why is it strange?? @cohhcarnage
yea angela and i were trying all that out
i confirmed it last night with friends
i think its good
@cohhcarnage have you heard the glitch when you go over 60fps the game or the player moves faster.. just the death gambit glitch
cohhcarnage it's rp sooo
no each have there own loot if in range and hit it
@cohhcarnage what game are we talking about?
thats fallout for you lul
it makes sense tho
isnt that how real world works? :o
the entire game is a weird decision
i kinda like that actually
i think its good
a lot of weird decisions for this game
but the lamp respawns, thank god
thats not right
its a big problem with fallout right there
its a commom mmorpg stuff
@cohhcarnage would you say that this is a western style witcher?
survive of the fitest
it promotes a pvp level of survival in a way
so many people have no idea what they are talking about. notlikethis
its a multiplayer game what do you mean?
i like it
thats why the items respawn so fast @cohhcarnage
entire fallout 76 is weird
exactly
its multiplayer kinda
so the first thing you do is look for bp's when you run into a room
weird decision and fallout 76 seem like a good combination from what ive heqard lul
gotta be somehow competitive
indeed. it promotes soloing and looting off on your own to get all the good stuff.
90% of f76 is a weird decision
most stuff of importance is in containers anyway cohh
wait when my and my friend played yesterday - all loot was individual :o
muh emergan
test it tonight cohhcarnage :)
its one big wierd decision '
co v op
are they really looking for realistic tho lul ?
yes 76 is very realistic kappa
those are the important things the bp's
but the pr dude on the conference said everybody can pick up the loot
so a server starts. everyone rushes for the best static loot
@cohhcarnage everyone in party gets loot from mobs killed. but not the same
why would it be different than every other survival sandbox?
you played with that lady princess and she didn’t get to loot what you looted
i'm sure it wasn't a decision but a limitation
actually it's laziness on their part... not needing to track a million items on whether you personally looted them or not, just auto-respawn ... :x
well they could implement a lottery system for teams like a need greed slider
thats how it should be personal loot kinda boring in wow
anything you can “open” is unique to you
i assume its subject to change
yea, i'm gonna watch cohh play before i commit to that one
it has to be disappear
i was just paying last night with friends it all different loot
it is not a mmo guys. 30 people on a server does not make a mmo.
early bird picks up the worm i guess
the marketing guy from bethesda
cohhghi cohhboop eschaap
drink champagne!!
@capnshredder i'm with you bud i like it
!quote
" barry stop lurking and scary the ish out of me every time you randomly appear! " - sharpeyedkitsune
so if you know where a good item would spawn you can just stay there till it spawns
what do you mean, my tp always respawns when the roll is gone cohhhmm cohhk
cohhcrazy cohhbeer cohheat
how else are you gonna reenact a mexican standoff
maybe they need roll for loot mod for teamplay
to be fair it should never have been multiplayer, at least not mandatory multiplayer but that's me
my major problem is the power armor
cohh, and remember it's beta, it may very well change before release
good morning cohhilition and mods and cohh cohhl cohhgv
you want to party up in fallout 76?
classy party

@excelion_ yes, container loot is for everyone different. but if you see random gun on the ground next to body. only one of you can pick it up. not everyone. containers work differently
well no npcs is a bit wierd too tbh
he doesn't want to get drunk.... again cohhlul
cohhdrool cohhbeer
chugs whiskey but sips champaigne
no we liked that items in containers were client based because we needed a lot of items to build stuff... so in a way it....solves the loot carry limit? anyways ye. i gtg do wedding stuff so will miss seeing your thoughts on it later. :(
he is still wasted from the eight bottles of whiskey
m´lady
cohhsip
the thing i ask bethesda to do is that when a place respawn, doors fridges and all that sould reset too
id buy fallout 76 but im worried about getting bored once ive explored everything
its too good to drint at once lol
he's pretending obviously...
r2 to drink
ive seen what you can do to a bottle of whiskey arthur, get it to together with that champagne
no cohh. it’s half empty.
grimmz getting jebaited
if you are in a power armor and die with more weight than you can carry without the power armor than it will not let you respawn near your death sometimes and it only happens like 20% of the time
!mods
no
m'lady
anneshucks anneshucks anneshucks anneshucks
@cohhcarnage its half full not half empty :)
mah immersion cohhrage cohhrage cohhrage
i'm sorry but fallout 76 is a cash grab and nothing else. forced mp when it makes no sense on loot, poor pvp mechanics, no npc's... endless.

@cohhcarnage nuclear take; undertale was incredibly overrated.
@cohhcarnage it was more fun than to play it yourself
@snapcatbandit oh god notlikethis lul
cohhhi cohhml cohhml cohhhi
@cohhcarnage to watch*
big problem with ut for cohh is that he likes good games
people kept telling him how to play because the undertale fandom is crazy too
i don't need a game to tell me what's under the tail

@cohhcarnage so glad i'm not the only one who didn't like undertale
jebaited
@koobs_lol because maybe he want to keep his beared a little longer, and instead put the quest aside.
@archangelm not a good assumption
@cohhcarnage good to see your not running your horse into everything cohh lol
undertale = horrible game lul
@psychonrails danbad
one of those over hyped games. it is a good game but people made me think it was some religious experience
@septimus787 that was not the point of undertale but i never liked it either
cohhcrazy cohhbeer cohhcrazy cohhbeer
yep
@drak0v no
yeah the hype killed it completely for me.
@cohhcarnage i'm only watching rdr 3, is it important to know the story behind rdr 1 and 2 ?

it was meh

@cohhcarnage you can play that game "wrong" ... because of how it's built...but honestly yeah, the fans get a bit too crazy about it.

yeah, even when i watched other people play deltarune, the undertale community showed it worst side
stop enjoying games and play them my way babyrage

wrong :d
undertale community is arguably worse than the fnaf community lul

does everyone hate micah?
ive learned no matter how much sense your logic makes, one guy on the internet is always going to disagree, and thats ok...
history is as enjoyable to play as tu read, it just comes to taste
@cohhcarnage if you skip tedious hunting "quests" and plant picking "quests", you will have plenty of time to complete all story related sidequests.
and ghosts
your eddie murphy impression is curselit curselit curselit curselit curselit
every rockastat game has ufo lul
cowboys and aliens
shorinji45 cohhl
never do stuff with micah. unless it's r2'ing him. roo4
cowboys and aliens !!!
no kidding
how could u even compare a cash grab to an actual masterpiece
red dead is one of the best games i have ever played i have played fallout 76 and cancelled my preorder
play a historically accurate game like mass effect kappa
a couple of them from what i've seen
@cohhcarnage how dare you say fallout isn't set in a realistic area, florida looks just like it!

@desarlion thks you, that's what i thought
thats a cover shooter for you lul
the division got better with time
division is absolute trash
cohhwut cohhb
division feels like it is a very poorly done mmo. such limited skills to use.
i thought the division was very fun
@cohhcarnage division is a diablo with guns xd
shooting simulator
division is bullet sponge : the game
it isnt what it was
the division got better with the dlc´s xd
i always felt division was super spongey roosip
yeah, thats division
@aghamyr i did, but no message box to write something
to
@balduram nah, that's destiny
but without it is bad
and here you do the same thing, just with less cover cohhlul
sounds like uncharted
space is wifi not reall at all fact never been ther no proof
yeah good choice there, division wasnt really worth the hype
its farming like any other game
its a real grind, it didnt hit its stride until the new modes were out
fallout 76 is exactly like division
the division underutilized it's cover system
kettenhobel_ it's a first-time sub; only re-subs can share a message.
i really liked the atmosphere and city of division. gameplay was solidly meh, like most ubisoft
don't use cover, hard mode
and now youre doing the exact same thing here cohh lul
at it's current state, division 1 is pretty good in terms of how the game works around now
it should have forced you to move around more
@nuuriell mi that late?
cohh i live in israel
"its not you, its me"
@shinnto can be too
@jokersindahouse get out
arent most games like that tho?
cohh never played the survival expansion feelsbadman
it would be a good game if it wasnt a bullet sponge simulation
some thing multiple times
division 1 looked promising at first and it kinda became boring and repetitive
@cohhcarnage read the letter in arthur's room
the fact that everything is a bulletsponge and you pop tons of abilities just makes it kind of bland for me
@jokersindahouse completely wronmg
@redbeansz nope
lul lul lul lul
@cohhcarnage was wondering what you thought of pillars of eternity? (quite long ago ofcourse)

not at all true. the gameplay is totally different

they're not the same, division is not as buggy asfallout
vebrin lol
how can you compare that?!?!?!
uh if by exactly you mean nothing like
that kid is delusional
yeah nah
how is fallout like division lol
and d2 with the forsaken dlc?
f76 is more like ark or rust than division
lol
but it's not about if i like it. i want you to like it cohh :(
interested in anthem?
76 is a fallout 4 dlc lul
?????????

this chat is just hating for the sake of hating fallout 76, they probably havent even played it residentsleeper

wow u actually read my comment and its 19k+ ppl here.. u are the best cohh!
problem is the division was trash at launch, now? 8.1? it's a new game.. now is the time to play it or try it out.

i felt it division didn't have any emotional bond with the enviroment
we got joker in da house cohhlul hahahah
cohhhi quick everyone talk so dendra_ can lurk unseen.
they are totally the opposites
where do you live cohh?
division is just like skyrim kappa
you know what game i think is better than both of those lemmings? i mean the way those little yellow things move around is way 10/10 imo
i can see what he means if you do the same thing over and over in both, but that is abou tit
@jokersindahouse not even funny to compare those two game styles
sadie kreygasm
@cohhcarnage sadie is main mission be reasy
fallout 76 is just bethesda version of destiny anyways kappa

@cohhcarnage we're gonna do sadie? oh my...
fallout 76 and the sims are the same game
oh :\
@phorner23 what how
hey @cohhcarnage pcgamer is now reporting that people are already modding the fallout 76 beta :o

fallout 76 is another fallout 4 reskinned

your preference are wrong, and you are wrong @cohhcarnage everyone who disagree with me is wrong :)

gets popcorn ready.....
@cohhcarnage i’m saying in the way that division and fallout 76 are both confused as to whether they are a pvp or pve game without choosing one
your opinion is wrong cohhlul chat cohhfail

wow sexy lady
sadie is so cool <3
i feel like fallout 76 is going to be fun to watch, i tried watching people play division 2 but it wasn't interesting. th at said, i have no interest in playing either game myself
exactly. i love the fallout setting and just exploring the maps so i'm pumped for fo76
sadie elaweeb
it was so close to being good, i played it for weeks and weeks but in the end they tried to revert what they did by boring game play with dlc but it never panned out
this mission is amazing
i thought division was good for its type of game
cohhgv
just putting my opinion out there...bethesda as a company sucks sacks
isn't fallout 76 just a pc based diablo immortal?
cant blive he saw my comment haha
lololol
it's about to get interesting right now, love this mission
sellout = cohh opinion cohhcrazy cohhf
division was better at launch... they ruined it with balancing in later patches... healing got out of whack and you just ignored the cover system.... kinda the basis of the entire game
the division has a little more to offer than that imo, but you get to enjoy it only in the "late-game" stage of the game... it's like warframe... very based of farming and farmin... actually it's how i discovered warframe.
i freakin love division's smooth gameplay
sadie reminds me of anne bonnie
i just wish bethesda would make a sequel to jade empire.
so many gamers are filled with hate nowadays. just enjoy the games you do, and let others enjoy the games they do.
i have 2400hrs in the division. its a great looking world but it is an insane bullet sponge you either accept the issues with or you don't play. its better now but still has issues. it is not fallout or anywhere near it.
sadie look hot
to little to late

@cohhcarnage the mary mission is actually pretty cool/funny if you do decide to do it, i think you'd enjoy. not required though i dont believe
if mary were good at life or able to change, she'd deal with problems herself, or be better at persuading the right guy to help
how long is the beard now? are you still taking the tonic?

will it come on pc? @inyobase

@cohhcarnage save side quests for pc
game already has pc files
@cohhcarnage why support double dipping?
is it comming to the pc?
that will be fun in the year 2022 feelsbadman
you keep hoping it will come out on pc cohhcrazy
double dip jebaited
@cohhcarnage there's so much stuff you just stumble across while riding around
cohhr2
probably will biblethump
in april they said
cohhmoney
''probably eventually'' isn't very promising @cohhcarnage
never
@i_made_that 2019 its already been leaked
just like rdr1 kappa
cohhmoney
i have to wait a whole year to play this
you say money, i say grab. cohhmoney
eventually i would assume. just like they did with gta v. hell i even bought it multiple times
@cohhcarnage or in this case, triple dipping?
they made a killing bringing gta 5 to pc
cohhsip cohhbeer
probably i mean better this game has already made 375million in couple days
@the_cassiopeia danscare
hopefully game speed isnt tied to fps for this game lol
@cohhcarnage it's comming to mobile first!
online comes out soon
rdr 1 didnt come to pc cause the coding was a mess
no rush to bring it to pc because people will buy it twice 4head
@the_cassiopeia too soon dude feelsbadman
if they develope it's online mode then more probably
money is a great motivator cohhcrazy
double dip + extar money from sony and microsoft
just like the first one did....
they should remaster rdr for pc, and give us remaster red dead revolver too.
they'll make at least if not the same ammount or more from console
they would make so much money if they released a pc version for christmas
though rdr 1 never made it to pc cohh
@cohhcarnage thanks for playing the console beta then kappa
hope they make a good port...
not just money, but an f ton of money
@cohhcarnage can your horse die? i want to play this but not if my horse can die lol
rockstar knows they'll make money regardless lmao
cant they turn it into a mobile game!? heared thats the new big thing
rdr didn't came to pc because it's code was a mess and it wasn't worth to port
maybe we will se it on mobil to :-)
a year or two????
cohhf
they say they won't, so people feel forced to buy on console, then they do later
@niorastv not since san andreas lol
max payne 3
@cohhcarnage no sirup in beer remember that cohh
that and hunting can be hella time consuming
just wait years bro
considering the money the made out of gta v pc they prolly will. most profitable game ever
@hasabey she asked you to rescue her brother and you when you did you basically got nothing from her except a thanks, this is an ex lover/gf we're talking about
that seems to be rockstars new formula. release close to a genrations end, release on next-gen, then pc...double to triple dip potential.
cohhhi
@cohhcarnage depends how much copies they will sell meanwhile imo
rdr 1 was never released on pc though
with how much people play gta online on pc that's a lot of money rockstar will be missing out on red dead online
microtransactions lul
@cohhcarnage rockstar will do a rdr2 mobile version kappa
!baby
yes! cohhwow laina is pregnant! we're expecting the next little one in april, 2019. thanks for being on this journey with us! updates as they arrive! cohhcheer cohhgv cohh.tv/babytweet check out the highlight here! cohh.tv/baby
with ps5
the double dip will be pretty insane for them
@cohhcarnage why do pc releases come so much later? :(
what is the big ?
they didnt bring the first one
they would earn so much money if they were to remaster the first and sell it with this one
unlike rdr it 100% will people oped it up and found pc files
@vebrin do you not have phones?
mikehogu current consoles are a lot eassier to pc port then rdr1
the game look so good
im pretty sure rdr2 had the biggest launch in media history. they would be crazy not to release it on pc
console player thing that rockstar cares only about them lul cute
they will prolly do the same thing they did with gta v
the double / triple dipping is straight up rude
some people actually bought gta v twice, first to console then pc
well they sold 12 million copies in the opening weekend.. just for consoles.. so pc better be a hit @cohhcarnage
milk cohhmy
cirgreed
@miklagard the first one did not get a pc realease because the game code was spghetti af

cohhgshow cohhgshow cohhgshow cohhgshow cohhgshow
they will make it as a mobile game
gta v sold more on pc
actually being able to aim and have sensible controls would be soooo nice. have tried to love this game but just can not get over playing this with a controller
pc cohhblush cohhblush pokbraixen
cohhfa cohhmoney
can i play this game with a mouse and keyboard on my ps4 ?
i'd bet less than a year
there is too much money in rdr online to not release it on pc.
read dead revolver not on pc? i could have sworn it is.
@nordunion123 you think they won't do a special release of rdr1 before rdr2 release
cohh is just cruising through these strangers
switch first
it's what they did with skyrim, and that didn't come out to other platforms for like, what, 3 years?
80€ game 5 years after original release kreygasm
byebuyingpie cohhwut cohhmoney
since gtav is the highest earning media piece in history, i think they know what theyre doing lol
we need a mobile version next kappa
it 100% is getting a pc release. they just want to make sure it gets received well so it's worth
i actually prefer it to be two years by that time i've forgotten most of the plot and can play it again.
they didnt bring the first because of the coding chat failfish
buy it twice, cohhevil
this game's earnings so far is only beaten by gtav so i really doubt rockstar isnt gonna grab all that extra money
cant wait to see the juicy drama if it comes to pc, just like with gtav dansip
so your money driven like most
@ted3959 yea they have to port to pc which takes a long time too, and they'll have to touch it up and add stuff
gta5 sales still havent dropped on console tho lol
just like diablo
cohh, there is code referencing to a pc version in rdr2 already so some have been prepped.
thanks for beta testing the game cohhcrazy cohhbeer
they'll probably wait until the goty version comes out to announce the pc version
pc users should boycott it
but the funny thing is the pc version of gta5 sold more than al consoles combined but lets make them wait too lul
by releasing it a year after pc release they get to absolute milk the console community and then pc players will buy the game and console players will rebuy the pc version which they will also milk the shit out of
cohh would you play wc3 campaign when remastered comes out?
@cohhcarnage the rp community is going eat this game up, look at what they did with gta5
business model lul
lul
2 years with ps5 than 1 year after that pc.
buy that time this game is crap compared to other games
cohhcrazy cohhbeer
roosellout genius
snake cards
@cohhcarnage ps5 / x2 :)
now with horse armor kappa
forgive me i haven't visited in a while but i though cohh already streamed every day? last watched just after baby cohn came along
sounds great feelsamazingman
4k res
@cohhcarnage cohh do you belive that this game will be and work on the geforce now ? sayng for the por pc players included me qq
lul
i won't buy for less than 120 fps
don’t forget about a goty edition too
forgot goty version for consoles with pc release lul
sharkcards
i just hope they are making a zombie expansion like the first one
destiny 2 dankek
gtav was old gen, current gen , then pc. for three times the sales.
they jebaited us again from gta 5 :d
lul
true that
maximize profit
and gta v is still selling lul
then they will introduce horse cards kappa
hope it comes out in a time frame similar to mhw
i will buy it twice because im a sucker lul
not very little extra work
@cohhcarnage i plan on playing the console version in third person only and when pc comes out i play it as first person only and it will feel like a new game!
its what skyrim is doing cohhhmm
@cohhcarnage do all companies do this?
and then a newversion for next gen consoles, tripple dip
they'll do mobile before pc
then ftp on pc lul
dont you get destiny 2 for free now?
it's like rtx
boycot is the only way
smart, slimey business
destiny lul people who bought that omg lul
for the same price too
that's 100% skyrim
@cohhcarnage why do you think they didn't do it with rdr1?
at least it's better than mtx
my thoughst exactly
mh: world is going strong on pc
the lesson is, never play game on consoles feelsamazingman
i own it on ps4 and ill buy it again for pc
monster hunter world and destiny are dead games
and buy a new graphic card too with that
step 1: $$$$ step 2: $$ step 3: $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
@cohhcarnage don't forget the remaster for the next gen consoles
cohhhi cohhmvp cohhml
@cohhcarnage dont forget every gta is on pc but non of the red deads are on pc
i just stick to waitinig for pc
!streak @ charliepink91
cohhhi thanks for 5 full years of streakin'! cohhmy cohh has been streaming for 1847 days straight! he has streamed every single day since october 14th 2013
pc version with deadeye would be too op probably
don't forget hyping up the moding for pc
3rd time :d
this game will likely properly support rtx and it's going to look ungodly on pc
ps5 launch title
rockstar have never done a goty edtion
@cohhcarnage its not cool
just dont buy it
bethesda did it.... how many times with skyrim? cohhlul @cohhcarnage

i just hope they re making a zombie expasion like rdr1
lul
maybe with the next console generation
@zetx2000 , im with you bro :)
will there be dlc ?
thank god cd projekt aint that like
and then a remake of the first uhngreed
i'd rather wait for pc version, i'm a dingus when it comes to aiming with anything but a mouse
meh, i won't buy twice either way lol
rdr1 isnt on pc tho katiet
thats why i play allmost all games a year after they come out, way cheaper, and the game are stright better after a couple of patches.
d: we call it double dipping
if u don't wanna buy it twice just wait or play it now and don't buy it on pc? lul
jump onto the train for fast travel :)
better than loot boxes
rockstar did more than double dipping with gta v lul
!time
cohhcarnage's time is currently 11:07 am est
@cohhcarnage dont forget about remastered version of rdr2 :d
their end-goal is skyrim levels lul
its called milkin the game for all the money possible
double dipping cohhrude
isnt pc porting a pain in the ass?
@joeshmo_tv chill with the caps, please. cohhgg [warning: 1]
more mainstream and more scummy
rdr mobile!
and then they release for ps5 and xbox 2
dont forget the mobile port lul
mmmmmmmmmm dubbel dipp
@cohhcarnage they may even bring out a mobile version
@cohhcarnage so like diablo???? lul
thanks for subbing @silv4cross! check your whispers (or contact a mod) if you'd like your shoutout! appreciate your support! cohhgv

your horse needs a butt cover
what timezone is the 2pm fallout beta in? for me 2 pm is 3 hours ago
bethesda perfected it with skyrim!
it's a bad business model. the problem is that we the players keep paying for it
fortunatelly we have cd project
@thoogah wouldnt even need dead eye on pc dano
@cohhcarnage i plan on playing the console version in third person only and when pc comes out i play it as first person only and it will feel like a new game! danhmm
that's why i play mostly indie and small dev games, less shady in general
and all these silly players just pay and play like there is nothing wrong with it
and then probably also a version for the new console generation
you need to get a new hat man
but then they take that money and turn around to make a game like this.
with mobile devices running games more efficiently expect to see triple dip
gta v sold over 10 million on steam, it's gonna come chat lul
it's so easy to write the same game for xbox and pc , ps4 is a little harder
what stage is the mobile port? feelsamazingman
double dipping sucks
the savagery
double penetration kappa
rockstar do it , it is a totally asshole thing to do but i can respect it because its genius from a business pov
@cohhcarnage still no hat :(
i want a pc port of a rdr1 remaster with my rdr2 cohhold
rdr3 on mobile hype!!
grunt huff grunt grunt
what cohh is trying to tell you is: don't be a fool and buy it for ps4
@cohhcarnage you think if they do bring rdr 2 to pc they might gives us original aswell ?
and then the new generation of consoles will show up and they will launch red dead 2 enhanced for new hardware lul
@fiv3dollar chill with the caps, please. cohhgg [warning: 1]
@cohhcarnage is there a reason to do the pc version later rather than first?
ya rdr2 mobile dont forget about it
so what we have to do?
@cohhcarnage i thought monster hunter world wanted to wait because they knew pc version would be batman arkham knight levels of bad if they didn't take their time?
just got destiny 2 for free thanks blizzcon
i wonder if they're going wo wait until the online is done to push out the pc version
hey @cohhcarnage and hey chat!
cohh, they will make it for next gen consoles then pc if they follow the same path.
is rd2 on xbox one?
you can play rdr1 on pc through playstation now
like blizzard?
step 1: $$$$ step 2: hold the door! step 3: $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

cohhhi cohhhi cohhhi
i sure love waiting years for shitty console ports 4head
blizzard double dip diablo 3 to console/switcg and now they will milk ppl for diablo mobile :(
i feel like it is never worth buying twice but people do it like crazy
why would i buy something twice?
there are 3 red dead games dont forget about red dead revolver
rdr immortal for mobile
red dead redemption cellphone gatcha battle royale cohhk
how many times did skyrim dip? :d
too bad rdr 1 isnt on pc
@cohhcarnage did your mama ever told you not to double dip
mobile danw
capitalismbb
@cohhcarnage wait till they can triple tip whit mobiles xd
diablo 4head
!time

rdr immortal for mobile?
!fallout76
skyrim is on its 6th dip ot more
cohhcrazy cohhknife the fallout 76 100% run! cohhomg join us at 8am est on november 14th for the beginning of our 100% exploration run of fallout 76! we'll be starting with an all-day stream of the wasteland and many full days afterward! our goal? every quest complete, every location explored and, well, everything done! rts and details here! -cohh.tv/fotweet cohhh see you then!
that's cause consumers don't hold them responsible.
gaming is dying feelsbadman
forget pc, the next major announcement will be rdr 2 for mobile. pogchamp
how many dippings did skyrim get?
we!call it double dipping
the other option is the wb games route where you just piecemeal another game from previous mechanics
holy hell almost 20k viewers!! cohhhi
rdr2 has made over 1b now i believe
there's going to be new better horses to buy every patch in rdr2 online roopog
i don't blame them. the development for one game alone is crazy
the pc version is going to come with a free keyboard! they know you'll rage quit and smash it
*cough* todd howard *cough*
i'm actually hoping for the second big game industry crash. where most all of the big companies are reduced to ashes.
cant wait for the microtransactions in the rdr2 pc port dankek
only sunday streamer? 20k viewers on reddead lol
if ghost of tsushima doesn't double dip then i'll have to get a ps4
free games are making so much money, that's clever
cant blame the companies for trying, the consumer are dumb enough to get scammed
just make mobile games
@cohhcarnage don
just keep pushing hhhehehe
the time of greed and it might cause a crash again like it did in the 90s
gta v has grossed like 6billion.
as little a possable
danw my money dangreed
just keep buying and preordering people jebaited
that's the more important part
business folks are calling shots, not gamers anymore
@cohhcarnage i really dislike how it is artificially pushing back pc release dates.
well, gaming has become mainstream. of course they try that now. it's called capitalism.
@cohhcarnage what do you think of that?
dont give in!
the switch is pretty much doing the same thing with skyrim and diablo, etc.
do you think there is any communication between distributors and microsoft/sony to potentially use the model to boost console sales as well?
resist!
battlefront 2 fiasco
i blame the whales dansgame
its a goldmine hehe
we really do live in a society :( bottom text
yeah
i'll give them less money than i give cohh feelsamazingman
just got outside 4head
@prophet_nl iv been a long time supporter since gta 1, sins of solar empire etc, but stopped buying since gta 4
ie console players are bigger suckers :p
how can we gouge our customers most efficiently? cohhhmm
*cough* skyrim *cough*
we live in a society.
and society has attention span of a week. and instantaneous
diablo as a mobile game is an example of this @cohhcarnage lul
danhmm
what should games really cost then to avoid this? we have been paying the same amount for a game for 20 years
no
gaming is the most lucrative entertainment business today
business is scumy lul
steam sale is my way
fire emblem devs made 400mil with their mobile game in 2 years
if we buy the game they'll make more of em ;)

what if he was framed d:
i am the law
his real crime? getting in my way cohhevil
well he's free now to afterlife
@cohhcarnage i plan on playing the console version in third person only and when pc comes out i play it as first person only and it will feel like a new game! danhmm
@cohhcarnage he is probably a victim of the war on drugs you dog
i guess cohh's been playing too much of thronebreaker :-)
cohhn
he gives you hints to loot =[
@cohhcarnage don't forget that they are milking the money with the least amount of effort from their side !
but @cohhcarnage havn't you escaped like 5 prison so far in this game?
cohhr2
lesson from shawshank: don't escape from prison 4head
if you save him you get a tip for a robbery
he was in prison for a parking ticket and he fell off the train on accident
@cohhcarnage he was innocent, just trying to get home to his wife and unborn child d:

lul
@cohhcarnage have you seen the ps4 pro vs xboxx comparisons?

i'd probably like the rain if it were grey, but the rest of the game is gorgeous so that's a nitpick from me ^^
it just doesn't work kappa
cohhhi it's a bird! it's a plane- oh wait no it is a bird. it's thecorvid! hide your art supplies!

it's old times rain, the clouds hadn't made good rain technology yet.
nice music
it aint rtx cohh
reminds me of fallout 3 ambient music
because its trash lol
that's a feature for the next system wetx
coh please display your aim assist settings please!!
fov !!!!
because it's garbage? rooblank
"some" lul
ap0cal1love you cohh
hyped too
cuz a lot of people don't like fallout because it is boring as sin to them (i am one of them ^^)
@cohhcarnage rtx does not work too well either from what i have heard, they have not done any driver updates yet, thus causing alot of crashes
@cohhcarnage pc release: improved rain realism and performance.
melee and grenade is still the same button
its yet again a hugely buggy mess by bethesda soft..
because its 10 days before release and the game is trash
what issues? haven't been on lately
rain is prolly an overlay on the camera. camera zooms in and it sooms the rain too
yeah, my social is broken, can't play with friends. :(
man....good think it's a beta, then...
the game doesn't look that much different from fallout 4. i think it looks a bit worse.
whats the consensus on ps4 vs xbox ?
how much anyone want to bet that nothing important will change before release?
whole point of a beta is to rip it apart
@cohhcarnage will you be doing a video on your thoughts on what they need to fix before release?
for pc-sales pitch: “better rain quality”
roo2 i wish it was good but it feels empty and boring
roger that thank you
thing*
can u get out now
!time
cohhcarnage's time is currently 11:14 am est
prove it cohh
@cohhcarnage its ok to love things that aren't perfect - like chat ;)
people forget beta isn't a finished game and should get over themselves
ice skating enemies irritated me the most lol
cohh you trash it because you love
moon2mlady
i played in the 76 beta yesterday and will today, i encountered a ton of bugs, but i still enjoyed the game overall, just needs some clean up
yes fallout does need a good amount of work but i enjoyed it a lot more yesterday running around doing high level stuff with friends was a blast
fallout games are broken on full release, never mind the beta
they ain't addressing shit in under 2 weeks, although i hope for all that're playing that they do
it has some design flaws that cant be fixed at this point
d:
cohhcrazy cohhbeer cohhn
@comcasttimesmeout on this game or in general?
like the fact that there's no anti-cheat or file integrity checks in fallout 76? lul
get out
u need to get out dude
they havent even played it lul
monkas
:d
this game
@cohhcarnage the crux of the issue is that they have so many issues with a 15 year old game engine and have too many bugs to release in 2 weeks...
lets not get in to debates about why fall is this or that
negativity brings in views
i dont like any games, just like to watch cohh play
wait people can have different opinions!! cohh
some ppl also prefer a working game
cohhcrazy cohhbeer
it's fallout 4.5 with mp, said it from the start. pretty sure it's just to fund es6 anyway

-.-
cohhm cohhm cohh biggest enemy....do not get cought missions
hi @cohhcarnage , chat pimpnitegift
when are we going to get rid of daylight savings time? @cohhcarnage
@cohhcarnage do you think f76 is gonna go the way of most games these days, where they push out a buggy mess then slowly patch it together once they've made their money?
thronebreaker today?
console has terrible frame probs for 76
there is a reason it's called beta
gawd the music tho
nada
cohhhi cohhd cohhd cohhd good morning and happy time change!
fo 76 is litterally fo4 engine with id soft netcode grafted on with no npcs because of engine incompatibility
@penoxi but theres only dedicated servers no public ones. is that not enough to give them control over cheaters?

@cohhcarnage so can you play fallout 76 solo or is it like mmo were other people run around everywere

every game has issues red dead is not perfect but i think it is one of the best games made to date for console at least and i am loving it on my xbox x.
@cohhcarnage through a chimney like a santa roovv
@cohhcarnage its because people expected another fallout and not 7 days to die 2
wat am i doing up here
f76 lul zekegod
@momolewd that's literally every fallout game though, that's a non-argument in this case lul
you must go indoors or fail
cohhhmm that was odd.
at the end of the day. here's bethesda games: it's more fun than most aaa games. even being buggy as hell and missing a lot of features. they know how to make fun games.
on't fall in the chimney
!
the thing with many bethesda games is that they are really really good games but technically fall short and after 20+ years of developing games they really have no excuse.
ninja music
im not a really huge fan of this game, but i'll still play it when it comes to pc
do not jump u are too young :p
fallout fans angry about fallout 76 and diablo fans angry about diablo immortal

yeah theres no good guy feel to this game
you are not a good guy
you're good if you don't kill him ;)
this is the 'good' way ?
yea they def make him out to be an anti-hero type in th estory
nothing personelle
you can try to be a nice guy but your loyalty to the gang makes you do bad things for dutch
good guy?! the same guy that shoots shackled unarmed people?!
you mean being american? kappa

i wonder if you can find arthur's corpse
going after money ending was so bad, because they randomly start playing rap song notlikethis
arthur does have the key to the camp funds.

those were thge bad endings

"guy with tb" as in you no1lol
barely different @cohhcarnage
you can see the bank loan in your journal @cohhcarnage
its irrelevant for the most part
did arthur run into the hillbilly in woods?
@cohhcarnage thats the bad ending decision that gets you stabbed
@cohhcarnage did you checked arthur's grave?
you made the right choice... trust me lul

@cohhcarnage there are 4 endings depending on your choice and your honor
@sevrez dutche's money, not the train money
same thing
@cohhcarnage i think you only get killed by micah and he laughs at your face.

@spero_mcgee i assume to give john
changes the ending
cant you go back in the cave?
john still makes it if you go for the money
they buried him.
bit all of us are good people
@cohhcarnage you get stabbed and micah takes money
you die in this game and have to be someone else no1pop

obv john is alive in the next game, so...
snapcatbandit cohhboop cohhl cohhgv
it's been several years since arthur died in game, the money is long gone
@cohhcarnage still micah would kill you and john escape
4 years later so no
@joku212 cohhgv cohhboop
different death
@cohhcarnage his grave is on a mountan top you can find it
joku212 cohhd cohhl

@cohhcarnage you can find 9 greaves, and you can visit them and by your respect.
r2 to loot arthur.
it's been years in game since arthur died
ofc dan would
feelsbadman
@m3rcer the reason to go with john was to keep him safe. id assume he would end up dead otherwise
same result if u go for the money and arthur is a grave
feelsbadman
find arthur's grave cohhhmm ?
do you lose all your loot lol
find it danmad
time to go grave digging
loot him you mean bury him right chat bros?!
like uncle ben in spoderman

@cohhcarnage i.m not good.. i'm great
i see a lot of smoke ahead
danbad
who buried him ?

john should go pay his respects

you play rockstar games for getting to places and dialogue anyway
i wish they would release rdr1 with rdr2 pc.
i wish they had a better fast travel system (go back to camp)
@jus10_90 yes, that means it's there, they put it in the game, there is just nothing to do (probaly will be use for online)
sadie pogchamp
its good country though
@urgval was. still keeps her ring though
@egergames i guess so but its a tad bit too much.
wth, u are playing as jon now?
@cohhcarnage i would say there's at least 100 hours a week worth of good writing in here.
bethesda will use an upgraded version of the creation engine for the elder scrolls 6 and starfield 4head
good evening chat! cohhhi cohhhi cohhml cohhml
sadie should have her own game.
arthur never existed. sadie has just gone crazy kappa
i am a pc gamer though this game is making me buy a console
@vileone1 or taxi
can fast travel from camp almost anywhere when you buy the upgrade
@urgval she was, her husband was brutalized by odriscolls
half of ac is running kappa
most open world is traveling... just saying
i am waiting for ajs review

adrenali_n roocry onslaught was amazing! wizards actually reprinted goblin piledriver in origins. big boon for goblins
dunkey does the best reviews
@gkl187 great game

@cohhcarnage i thought you were going to say, "how much money for a cohhilition house like this"
cohhhi just like old times, ringhammer.
@cohhcarnage 1 million dollars! muhahahaha
it would be insane
@tehmud heh
and watch john die in hd
rockstar could outsource it to a chinese company to make rdr mobile
it would have been cool to just continue the story on to rdr1
3.50$

@cohhcarnage depends on how much overtime you want in the budget??? cohhk
just play rdo

give modders the ability and it'll be done in a year tops.

@silentstormau chill with the caps, please. cohhgg [warning: 3]
@cohhcarnage rather than money it would probably take 100 hours of work per week cohhk
the map is already there. pretty sure they remake it
3.50 million
tell em they will turn a profit and we won’t have to raise any
plus tax cohh
kkona

oh boy, imagine if they remained morrowind in the skyrim engine kappaross
@cohhcarnage well they remastered l.a noire so heres hoping

rdr 1 is still nice to play though
cohhmoney
kkona
lul
tree-fitty...million
don't fall for that trick
mistah rock staaahr !?
cohhmoney
cohh maybe rockstar does and then release it for pc, apparently the rdr 1 code is too spaghetti to release for pc, so they might
they just need to release rdr for pc and modders will make it look good
haahaha
@ralock chill with the caps, please. cohhgg [warning: 1]
thought it was john marston turns out it was dat got damn loch ness monstah
rdr1 is already in the game lul
@cohhcarnage got dam loch ness monsta!
has long is not the loch ness monster asking
git a bank loan
@cohhcarnage rdr1 in 4k doesnt look that bad
@cohhcarnage judging by how the games industry is going at this rate, all the money wouldnt be enough feelsbadman
@cohhcarnage the entire map from rdr1 is in this game, apart from mexico.
we need this on pc first @cohhcarnage
cohhwut
rdr1 looks really good on xbox one x in 4k
@cohhcarnage it would be one of the few proper remakes rather than remasters
depends on how easy it to put shark cards in it
you'll get the blueprints to the game and have to build it yourself
rdr2 and rdr1 on pc for a combined $100. i would buy that.
1 pole. 1 frigging pole.
@cohhcarnage : it basically is already in the game
rockstar is not a good game company to develop for though...
the whole map is already in the game, cohh
well this game made billions in 3 days and sold as many copys as rdr1 in 2 weeks as rdr1 did in 8 years
its the lochness monster!
use r2 for that kappa
coolstorybob coolstorybob
true.. maybe we can sign a petition @cohhcarnage
where are u going
@cohhcarnage one more train and we got the money for rockstar
i would buy that for a dollar cohhwaii cohhwaii
@cohhcarnage with how much they made in 3 days im sure there thinking about it
@cohhcarnage 3.50$ per person who'll ever play such a remake that is
they already remastered rdr1
r2 to remake rdr1
i think they will
rdr1 still holds up
@cohhcarnage is rdr2 a prequel to rdr1?
not that you won't lisen to a non sub, but most of rdr 1 is already in rdr 2
and make it for pc!
yes
i'd buy it

@daanootje cohhl
@cohhcarnage are u saying that cuz rdr2 is boring ? cuz i think it is
i would pay full price for it.
rdr1 never got a pc release, so a pc release is about time, cohh
i would buy it... three times
@cohhcarnage gib mr. rockstar a howler' :d
i mean all the voice work is done already so they could probably
rdr first one was one of the most expensive games made
@hav3nsblade even mexico?
@cohhcarnage and put it on pc
id gladly trade in multiplayer for rdr1+un
on pc too cohhomg
remake in this engine and sell it on pc for unlimited money!

mexicans, californians and normal people.
shpshifter112 cohhghi
@ninjapants82 at that time, no
sadie voice actor is in a west movie
@cellobrother no this is john now
cellobrother this is the main char from rdr1
@cohhcarnage how did john solved his problem with law? didmt he had bounty on his head?
@cohhcarnage i guess it's safe to assume if they're not in rdr - they're "removed" in rdr2 - so dutch, bill, john, abigail, javier, and the boy - make it?
@chase_larson_96 which one?
@buzuj he has, he's 12 years old at this point. in rdr1, which is in 1911, he's like 15 or 16
feller lirikk

cohhwut
rip va lul

yep
just like spiderman
yes
yup theyre gods
damn
yes
details poggers
crazy
yes
yessuh
maybe
they also have different lines when they are getting back on track "where was i..."
wow
yes
yes
that's cool
how do you know this ?
they do that if you're far away
yup
pogchamp
yuuuup
indeed tey are
yep ype
that's pretty cool
yep
kreygasm
spiderman did the same thing
immersion! pogchamp
liek spiderman @cohhcarnage
immersion man
rockstar attented to detail kappa
no
spiderman did that too cohh
say hey to people that is far away and he will yell "sir" to them, cohh
damn that's insane
same as spiderman cohh
100 hour days
100 hour work week.
is this the future of games? because wow
yessss
how you think they got 500000 voice lines
i was thinking the same
@cohhcarnage 100 hours per week btw
different variable
yes
thats what i noticed
yes, every voice line
no wonder it's such a large file size. monkas
yup
yes
pogchamp pogchamp pogchamp pogchamp
like spiderman
yep 3 distances
naaaaaaaaamacro audio editing
like spoodermin
little details @cohhcarnage praise rockstar
yes he did
they would only have to turn up the volume
yes, its called 'engineering' @cohhcarnage
top tier game developing
doppler effect
game is too immersive
test it
@cohhcarnage like spiderman and him swinging vs non swinging
those 100 hour work weeks weren't for fun cohh @cohhcarnage cohhlul
yes. you have it at the very begining of the game in the snow aswell @cohhcarnage
cohhhi as manda0231 strolls into chat he says,"cohhhi cohh and amazing chat ^.^
no, probably through an audio filter
yepppppppppppp
takenrg giveplz takenrg giveplz takenrg giveplz
yep
they better get paid well for that. the strain on the voice would be hell
@cohhcarnage every line was recorded twice once normal and once yelling
for science!
i think its more sophisticated than that
yup you guessed it cohh
bring on the nukes set to phaser
@cohhcarnage they did the same with spider man
no wonder his voice cracked
the budget for this game was like $300 million i think
that explains why this game's size is soooooooo big
thats why they all speak so loudly when youre sneaking i think
also john va did every stranger mission too incase you wait to do them as john
@cohhcarnage the amount of detail you missed in this game by rushing it is astonishing by the way, there is a lot of crazy details
wow these games got a lot put into them its amazing
@cohhcarnage some dialogue sequences are also "alternate" depending on if you had to restart because you died.
@cohhcarnage same as in spiderman, yeah
yep
cohh same with spiderman
real good and sturdy kkona
the va started working on this game 2013
lul chat calm down its not something that big.
maybe it's just clever sound effect?
thronebreaker today coh?
cohhlul
yup it does that with all convos
v/a's better get double pay for that
goty @cohhcarnage ?
and then they can't whisper when they sneak behind an ennemy lol
test it again?
wasn't that scripted?
@cohhcarnage like matt mercer said, devs are starting to take care of voice work
let's test
spiderman on ps4 does the same
no he did that in my game to and he was right next to her
test it
could you try it again @cohhcarnage cohhhmm ?
nah they recorded soooooo many voice lines for this game
maybe she always is further apart there though
test it again 4head
@mastaz911 tomorrow
@cohhcarnage run away and try it
reload we need to test it
zeke had to work hard with that john voice
test it?
dat rockstar quasilty ..............
@flexibilty doubling ever open world voice line is a lot of work
why do you think his voice is so scratchy sounding @cohhcarnage ?
test it
!splat
do it again cohhwaii
at the cost of not having a frustrating inventory management
@flexibilty it actually is, nearly doubling the voice acting is expensive
@cohhcarnage thats dedication right there
100gb game monkas
i thought i noticed that other times
i thkni there going slow vo. going fast vo, long distance vo
get her stuck!
@cohhcarnage most of the times he will repeat what he said or wait for them 2 repeat it
plz feed horsey biblethump
pretty sure its scripted
i found mike in rdr2 pogchamp
chippetychaps i mean they get paid by the line if they do two lines they do get paid double technically
she on you
shoot her. that will slow her down
cohh gta 5 had same thing.
country roads
for science
@cohhcarnage did you really only just notice that after 50 hours ?
they stopped talking cohhlul
its easier to see at the start of the game when you follow people
i beat the game, it happens all the time. they will yell if ur far away
horse?
"return to sadie"
🐴 ?
horse?
horse ? kappa
i'm on a horse
scripted?
🐴 ?
it wasn't scripted, happened before to me with arthur
really horse cohhlul
horse?
@cohhcarnage i think rockstar are the ones that really started that and set that standard. other companies/games do the same thing nowadays
horse hoarse lul
dont horse around, cohh
horse?
🐴 you say?
she's wanting to fraternize with you cohh cohhlul
horse?
horse?
did someone clip it?
🐴
@psychonrails hoarse
🐴
horse ay? lul
kill her horse for science
hey guys! when cohh will end thronebreaker?
@egergames oh lul
zeke yells all the time, i can confirm
@cohhcarnage i doubt it, cause voice acting is taxing physically and alot of yelling is hazardous
horse
its not scripted, happens alot during the game
@cohhcarnage will you play diablo 3 on switch? there are new amazing quests in the campaign :d
i had an epic rare horse in the first part of the game. anyone know if i can get it back in the epilogue?
reload
it isn't scripted
like a pony? a little horse?
different person,you say? kappa
🐴
@quomp @beliskner666 so? its still not something to get crazy over it.
🐴 moon2mm
not scripted
@cohhcarnage just kill her horse then you can get some distance
i dont understand that reference. what does that mean ?
no its not. every line in the game can be yelled
🏇
like a horse person? @cohhcarnage
i have a horse voice too kappa
i scripted it :)
kappa her getting stuck was scripted
its not scripted, happens all the time
it wasnt scripted
he sonds like zeke when yelling
zubhowdy howdy cohh zubhowdy
not scripted. did not happen with me.
are you close to the end
the guy who does john's voice is amazing, and it's the only va work he's ever really done
@psychonrails english language mate cohhd
maybe her distance is reprogrammed.
its not scripted, they always yell if ur far away
but if they always follows you... seems strange...
can you imagine those two having sex? lul
it wasnt
@cohhcarnage not scripted
@flexibilty well, i disagree :)
dumt roo3
cohh say hey to someone far away and you will hear it again.
r2 to get some distance on her
its not scripted cuz ive noticed it multiple times throughtout my playthrough

@cohhcarnage she did get stuck because she did one of the standard lines to come on or wait up.

@franchise2020 same arthur yells when your far too
i often think americans sound like other americans. strange that no1blank
it wasn't i've owned an arabain the entire game and am always way ahead of npcs following me
maybe the getting stuck was a bug they couldnt get rid of and covered it up
zekehulk brother!!!
have you ever heard zeke be quiet, its so scary
zeke=loud john marston confirmed.
cohh i dan play and it does that as you get far away for any dialogue
cohhghi cohhghi
@psychonrails cohhd a little reading helps tbh cohhgg
maybe it is zeke.. cohhwow
the bug is feature
cohhcrazy cohhbeer bcwarrior

watched*
@egergames cohhgg
@cohhcarnage i wonder how long the recording took
dartheant cohhghi
i want a skyrim in this engine
can confirm, when i had a super fast horse it would happen to me all the timne
how far along are you @cohhcarnage in the game?
@cohhcarnage don't let zeke know otherwise he's gonna do inpersonations nonstop
what is cohh talking about?
what ending did cohh choose with arthur
@cohhcarnage hey cohh. i thought you finished the game
what happened to arthur? <3
what system are you playing on? |
feed horsey :(
@cohhcarnage they did the same recording for every line of dialog durin travel so if u were out of talkin range they would shout
have we seen zeke and john in the same place together? monkas
who is zeke?
it's the same thing with spider man, cohh. recorded for calm and while exerting
polish guy house
@cohhcarnage if you interrupt dialogue, john / arthur also says something like "so back to what i was saying.." followed by the rest of the dialogue
jessmaroli bcwarrior
cohhlul
and clean your guns
lul
@daanootje geers made some revamp to all of his emotes.
@quomp woah lul lul lul yeah man you know me as my own family does. good guess. keep going on with that attitude.
i feel like there are a lot of crazy details many people dont value enough or care for at all 🤔
@cohhcarnage, you are right. it was not scripted and is on all dialogue
why
@jessmaroli ezekiel_iii
@cohhcarnage so if you're following someone for a mission and you go in a shop and your partner doesnt they will get really loud so they can still talk
wax the horse
every riding mission they did dialogue twice, they will yell if far away.
biblethump
this time, without the snow lul

gold1640 cohhghi
not higher then 1500$,that's for sure
@miklagard that was arthur
tree fiddy
lul
arthur was a few thousand, probably similar
like ruffy
5k
5000k
@cohhcarnage 5000
5k dollas
3,50 k
interesting dialogue tbh.
last they said was 5k
cohhderp
arthur had like 5k if l remember right, does that mean sadie would kill arthur?
is there a difference between being wanted and having a bounty?
5k ish
5k bounty for arthur
you could remake rdr1 for that bounty money
i thought it was 1200
5 dorrars x 1000
probably more than 5k at this point, considering all the things they did
@cohhcarnage did you buy the new shotgun?
is it still $7 a person?
@janus32 i imagine they all got the same bounty
cohh gonna "stealth" again
what a head
probably something above $1 ;)
5 million beli
cohhr2 to find out bounty!
but he was a good man kappa
it feels like this epilogue is at least half as long as arthur part

it will scab over, right? kappa
theres wigs too
@janus32 nah, the brain is fine, but your skin is open and it is a big qound, so you die of an infection later
allow the hat to fuse with your head

scalping is when you cut off the hair bottom that essentially holds your upper part of the head. scalp deep enough and you might even cut the skin down to the skull bone
snek
cover it with leather cohh
you were supposed to stealth!!!!!
@the089beast they cut your skinn off your skull from the hairline all around. if they wanted you to suffer they could burn the wounds and you'd suffer for a week plus

set a dead zone in the emulator
fix deadzone or other controller

it also happens if you hold it up when you plug in, it sets it as "neutral"
tfw gamecube controller quality has decreased over the years pieregret
bingo board and piecomfy
drifting pieblethump
er hold it down in your case
can you believe this game is $111 used on amazon?
cant you hold y+x+start or some similar combination of buttons to reset it?
up the deadzone on it, so it takes more movement on the stick to actually translate to it moving in game.
my right joycon started drifting recently too feelsbadman

gba animations were dope
you can set it to only be on for certian people if you want
this is probably better anyhow
@daro16 serenes forest says it is.
they look better in the squel
tfw streamer is a hater
ok now this is epic
gba animations were wayy better
animations get better when you get cooler units
crit animations in this game are poggers
but are still not as good
why does everyone play this with the gamespeed as slow
any fe game that released after the gba games don't deserve to have animations on tbh
this should be the standard lul

can enemies crit you multiple times in a row
fire emblem should have a option to only animate battles that would have critical hits
vulernary.
she's so good
@yukariyakumo yes
@yukariyakumo why would they not
@yukariyakumo if they have a chance to crit and are able to hit more than once, yes
enemies dont pay their crit insurance
is this the definitive fire emblem ? @iateyourpie
@yukariyakumo if you mean can an enemy crit twice if they double, yes. if you mean can 2 different enemies crit you in the same turn, yes
the premiums are too high

really makes you feel like spyro
the flutter is so good, best addition
the flutter is so cute
@mishtershmee i thought that was crash brownthink
how are they teaching you to be a dragon if they never met one
yes because apparently the first boss in spyro 3 is "too large a difficulty spike" and the game is "too faithful" too the original brownfail
move over crash spyro is the new dark souls
https://clips.twitch.tv/yawninginexpensiveaxewholewheat
ray how come you’re not doing the cheats for like 2d and big head for bits? just wondering
crash is old news. this is the new dark souls of dark souls.
other than the flying segments that are a bit hard for me... other than that this game is easy as pie xd unlike dark souls
is the bit war still going on?

brownkobe
answer
what does low latency do
@autumn_sunrise answer
it shortens stream delay
it makes it so their is less delay
^
use google next time muscle brain
low latency is so much nicer
kevin is a booli
quicker stream interaction poggers
there is less delay you say? hmmmm
1080p60p is still good
don’t let kevin booly you
grthey ray hows it going
:tf: its fine, we're friends
isn’t muscle brain redundant

brownhey ray and chat!
hi 1995
yeah i was wondering why that a hole couldnt just do all of that
brownhey thatguy
i thought spyro was supposed to be purple and orange, why is he so pink
he couldnt shut down the switch, because then he is liable for shutting down the factory, all those lost jobs
you also get friends in 3
"i love you" "message read 9:15pm"
@zelderfreak even worse: "i love you" "....okay then"

it's a skin @russianrupees
come back
i don't even remember
some you need to go back
i think so
instead of abilities its characters
in 3 with the newer characters you need to come back
ya whenever i get emotional with someone i just turn off my switch and i play stardew later
its about 50/50 on whether you have to come back
@brownman a mix of both
come back kid
@autumn_sunrise ohh okay thanks!
same but with characters
spyro 3 has this rad ass penguin
i remember very little about spyro 3
why is spyro pink?
sadly not named kowalski
and the monkey
i love the animation for the gates building themselves
im glad they redid all the cutscenes
3 is the orginial skylanders
its also real obvious when you find a bit you need to come back to
:tf:
the kangaroo
le epic electroll
!uptime
even glimmer has a cutscene if you go back
@brownman plan on play the new fallout soon?
and lt. byrd
are rage faces in again
oh ya is someone here named kowalski so i can ask them for analysis
they just killed a guy :)
the penguin is probably better than spyro himself
!uptime
kangaroo waifu
@blitz0x poggers is there a club full of penguins?! a... club penguin if you will?! bronwjokes
chat, my spirit animal is the yeti
kowalski, analysis
brownjokes
im glad i dont live where theres ice and snow
why is spyro so monotone in your version ray
i'm not a huge fan of shiela's new redesign
i deserve that spelling error
is twitch's encoding going high again ray?
kowalski paralisis
it also has a nerd names bently in it
romanian i miss club penguin so muxh
i remember that challenge being a bitch for little me

gottem

@iiithedeadmaniii i also thought the archaeologist/safari look was kind of lame

the character designs in this game are a+
tom
@blitz0x yup?
hey babe the thing is live now do you want me to make a command for it?
@blitz0x i hope your joking
i cant type prue

@blitz0x ik it is but better than og i think not
sponsored by slimjim? kevin?
prue ding dong ur wrong
hello
for me
well the man is dead so you have an advantage
ppz is better than the og
they also got rid of the spirit mechanic for activating power ups in 3
yoda?
slim jims are kinda greasy
ray have you seen the creamer video with macho man? @brownman
he was the only one to get raptured. the cream really does rise to the top.
but then you're both in the same catagory: slim jim salesmen
raphael shouldn't be last brownrage
bone saw is ready!
@thespareparts its an ingame cheat, color is being decided by bit war
ooooooohhhhhhh yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
someone get me a magnifying glass bc i cant find the lie
someone had to be last moon2shrug
@brownman you might need go look into control schemes maybe for those underwater controls if they are there
how many people do u think eat slimjims because of him
you could be nacho man ray narvaez jr
you cant spell randy without ray
@selendra_shaldreth ohh, thank you
it's worth the shot
hallo! brownwut
eric brownlul
i just realised why he is called spyro jamie24inhale
lol eric
brownhey @kopczynski
at least since the game just came out people can't backseat kappa
its like 1 degree of seperation away from being friends with randy savage. the degree itself being slim jims
he glows now
still cant believe i was gifted a sub at the end of red dead. browngift
oh hell yeah
hey, not pink
he looks so cool
ayyyyyyyy ray "the brownest of men" narvaez

@champez2014 you get it 10 days early
your horse aint lookin too good partner, give it a rest.
stupid question. can you play this game in no-kill mode?
so that means the bfv release date is on 18th nov?
terrencebx you can lasso people and shoot guns out of hands. but i'd imagine there's still a lot of people you are required to kill
its a party
@champez2014 no its the 19th, and the game you can play tomorrow with origin premier
you'd probably get shot in the ass a lot, but it seems possible
you have to kill like 30 people in the tutorial lul
thanks for the answer.
19th ah ok i get u

sorry sac, i came into chat. people are allergic to me burkecry
alasdig alasdig alasdig alasdig
its the ginger curse comming to get youy
ok so the origin $30/yr service allows for 10-hours of play
i dont even know why they still add motion blur to games, like 99% of ppl just turns it off as soon as they fire up a game lul
how?????????????
is a ginger ^^
@nerepla350 do i spelled it wrong? this is one of the few things i can in turkish
how how how?
tfw the game defaults to ultra settings
dx12 enables?
stod is just getting into the game btw sac.
@sacriel can you explain to break how to play bfv today?? he is losing his mind
mischiefbear in the beta that option gave terrible fps
120?!?!?
toggle steady scope? sacwut sacrly
@johnnyarks origin access gives 10 hours. origin access premiere is just like owning the deluxe edition.
not once have i ever been like, but does it have motion blur pog
playing with a controller cohhm
@sacriel are you alergic to yourself ?
where are rtx settings?
how can you play?
they spend all that time building up a big mood with the intro. then you have to back out to fix the settings. failfish
hans zimmer made the music for this game kreygasm
@nikolai_von_imhof premiere is expensive
raredan
@genuinerng yes true
@ryhv i know right and i swear it doesn't make cinematic scenes any better
!rdfg
sacriel is using rdfg as his movement keys in most games so he can have access to more keys to the left on the keyboard. https://clips.twitch.tv/happyfreezingbaconprchase
wait wut
12 years a slave soundtrack now?
@sacriel rtx on?
is br avaiablabe
does battlefield v have a br mode?
available
mownarn no
guys if anyone is interested, on battlenet, if you didn't know. destiny 2 is free for pc atm. (i think it's still active)
can feel a sick day come on for the 20th lol
br is not available yet
ty
br isn't in until march
@nerepla350 ah alright :)
music is epic
does bfv have a single player?
why isn't it available wtf
@johnnyarks yes and no, but understandable. if you only plan on playing here and there it is good. so you can pay say $60 a year for multiple games, or pay full price for the game all at once.
march really?
has this released ?
overkill's the walking dead is out now! a four player co-op action fps, you can fight the dead...as well as the living...check it out: https://smarturl.it/sacwalkingdead

!highlight settings and key bindings
highlight added!
what keybinds do you use? :)
release is 15.11
@johnnyarks yes
why can sacriel play today already?
:)
it came out early.
@whisperme rdfg!
cause hes a boss
what keybinds are you using?
because of origine access prime
!rdfg
sacriel is using rdfg as his movement keys in most games so he can have access to more keys to the left on the keyboard. https://clips.twitch.tv/happyfreezingbaconprchase
!rdfg
wow this rdgf keybind idea just blew my brain up
@typehazard :)

hows the fps per seconds?
a tank is a tank can't expect a nerf from them. if u do ur s fool
that's dumb
yeah, but a direct hit should still a person
maybe the ammunition
that must be deadly hit
why can streamers play earlier?
it's fine, it's just a little metal raizc
good
type
lmao
70 ? lmao
that's dumb as hell
keep in mind bf games are arcadey, not realistic
my downloads at 30% :(
that almost looks bugged
nerf shells
that's a good thing tho
people were using the tank's mg before they even nerf it lul
a tank shell should kill wtf lul
might just be damage falloff? so that tanks actually have to move into the fight rather than snipe
wasn't there two types of ammo in tanks ?
their tank is probably at c
@sacriel can you move your cam so we can see the ammunition count?
would be a little op if all those shells one shot though
direct shell hit = 70 dmg. sounds right lul
whys he so small
at least it fires fast
@sacriel might be fall off damage and ap founds
it has a fast fire rate tho
it's literally an at gun too. this is the 40mm variant. that's some big ass bullet for 70 damage
dansmile just getting hit directly by a explosive shell, no prob.
better off just using the aux
im glad tanks cant snipe easy kills from far away now. its was stupid in bf1
overkill's the walking dead is out now! a four player co-op action fps, you can fight the dead...as well as the living...check it out: https://smarturl.it/sacwalkingdead
@shannonzkiller when did they change the time? i still have the countdown after restart. (i can launch now tho)
the germans are absolute units, imagine taking a tank shell to the body forsenkek
phy3eri i dont have that answer. youll have to ask ea.
a tank shell should blow the body into million pieces
im sorry but am i the only one that thinks it would be really cheesy if a tank can sit in the back of the map and oneshot you?
they should make it that direct hits still kill, but keep the explsion and splash damage as it is now
!access
anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
bloody obj :d
your tank got defective ammo
lmao that voice tho lul
@ミッチ just stand up 4head
@bumrushbill no i’m with you
sacwave
yea fack balance am i rite chat 4head
lol
op
pog
don't you need access premiere and the pre-order ?
dear ea stop nerfing everything because that's how you lose profit
that aux gun is a beast
anyone elses audio keep stopping? or just me?
is the game out or ?
be better off with a tank that shoots samsung phones out of it
@sacriel doesn't it get boring in vehicles?
fack logic
sacl
where is enemy panzer
lul
building 👉 rip
so good
enemy hit...with tank shell.... 54 damage
it thats a valentine with a 2 pounder, they never had he shells made for them
i mean....
i'm still sad they removed full building destruction
hmm, now i'm doubting to switch my pre-order to a origin premier instead
'ello there soldier 4head
kinda sad
destruction is rly nice in this. bc2 level
fortnite lul
killfeeds ruins the immersion imo dansgame
ello mate
@hoggy he's gotten a few direct hits already, they do 70 damage with body hits for some reason
@hoggy it’s a tiny gun that fires fast t needs to be balanced mate
fairness over reality i suppose
sacawk
immersion? from what? killing 100s and dying 10 times and resurrecting? dansgame
tank shells = sniper rounds
you want immersion!? open mics dood. that's how you feel really apart of the world
i think the tank shells deal less damage, so one can't spam them against infantry. timps
there's a tank in my living room!
who gave sacriel a driving license
anybody home 4head
very nice :d
lets talk about the realism of picking someone up after they just got lit up by a ton of bullets
at the drive in!
@pigl33t lul
decrease the rof and increase the damages thats easy
valentine coming through ♿
sac just comes in for tea with a tank 'don't mind me'
u guys see that guy knifing the other guy next to sac?
why decrease rof
it's fine as it is
the center walls of building are made of the same thing as infantry uniforms. invulnerable to tanks.
parked the tank in living room rofl lul
cant u rearm at c ?
this is battlefield, not arma 3. don't expect too much realism and common sense
it says 2 pdr so if historial it is ap only.
can't see shit, the video game. cynicalaward

but it does look good, im sure theyll fix the majority of bugs
@rchardkuklinski say 1 game that never got any bug or problems the first day of "release"
one of the devs tweeted about scope glint, it is definitely back and is definitely brighter for higher power scopes.
!access
+1 on lemings
anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
so what exactly do you think caused that?
people who can play today actually paid less.. timpsmart
ohhhhh bf5
some of yall are so toxic, it shows whats wrong with todays gaming community notlikethis
every game has weird bugs, nothing new
@fluffyabsol 15$ per month isn´t really cheap ...
you going to snipe the crap out of people
can you not browse the servers?
where the rest of your kingsmen today?
i want bfv immortal :)
well that answers that
@nhaezer oh i’m sorry i forgot to insert my sarcasm because people online get way too offended nowadays lul hey guys i was being sarcastic in my previous message in chat fyi failfish
sniping was so satisfying in this game though
show us tank upgrades :d
@murphy1rng get a job and it's cheap
the snipe changes in beta were amazing, why did they revert it?
maybe remove all maps
they should at least add an item where you can remove it.
they make 10kw light bulbs?
why did they not have it in the open beta and then add it in afterwards, thats what i hate
its bf they nerf everything!
@exczist well i got a job, so your argument has no value.
remove sniper it's easier lul

there wasnt any scope glint when you played earlier no?

oh man, oh man
just restrict the snipers per team
@sacriel you cant go off 1 persons word research it and see if it true
ew, they're adding the sniper glint back?
@sacriel turn on killfeed? and move your head to the left a bit
they could've just put like a scope mesh onto the weapons via attachments to removve flare. why do they need to havve it persistant and brighter than before.

you now have kill log: hide

@rchardkuklinski don’t talk shit and get offended when someone says something back lul
what's up
kill log is still off
missed it
it says kill log hide or show peebroderp
you skipped over kill log show
@sacriel kill log: show
kill log still turned off
@sacriel you need to click show on kill log
@sacriel i think you have to set the kill log to "show"

how does the game feel?

hatefuldread, anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
well @nhaezer my first message about pushing the release date back and still can’t get it right was all sarcasm... i’ve been playing the bf franchise since bf modern combat 2 on the ps2. lulz lul
@murphy1rng then stop wase money on stuff .. i have 3 game cards on wow and i earn abit over 28k per month and thats not so much compare to others
so in bf1 the marksman scopes didnt have scope glint. is that still true for bfv?
@omacbeth he just started
lul
is the br mode of this game is already released?
show kill log @sacriel was an option besides what you want to see on the kill log option.
ah so its just premier?, i have basic sadly
guns bigger than it so prob not
@xjumb0 not yet
its a bit big i think
@omacbeth the game feels like cold pizza. hope that helps
lul
@bumrushbill glint is back for now
that guns too big for a bike bruh
lul cheeky one
@xjumb0 march next year ma dude
@rchardkuklinski in that case, pardon me
does this game only have one map? lul
i actually think the best kill log setting is my squad, it's that a possibility
some you can some not
@aottospeanuts you're a cold pizza.
stugging
it should have 8 :d
@pigl33t yeah but for all scopes? in bf1 glint was only there for the sniper scopes, not the marksman scopes
@killwin so far he's gotten rotterdam and this map twice
i was killed by a shingle
wutface
@omacbeth [oo](_|\.)[oo]
@exczist 28k per month isnt much per month? in which world do you live?
you'd think they'd show this map less xd

@bumrushbill no idea what the difference would be between them since snipers are marksmen?? but sac saw a guy with a glinting scope before
weird
so dumb, i feel like weapons should be faction locked

@frozyeso ohw.. timps
monkas
monkas
raresac
ohw.. can one switch factions, now?
@frozyeso no, you don't. you would if you got the deluxe edition, which i got myself, and i got cucked by ea (surprise) with 15th november being the release date. so basically i paid almost one year worth of origin access premier for a single game, and yet people who paid ten times less get to play a week earlier
sacflex1 sacawk sacflex2
@dragoonseal what version? origin on pc? i have deluxe on ps4
minik ops
has game already come out ? or is this some kinda stream benefit ?
!uptime
the current uptime is 2 hours and 29 minutes.
!access cresnik93
cresnik93, anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
you could really do yourself a dmg on those shelving brackets
!followage
if you have bttv, type /followed or check here http://twitch.center/follow
did this come out already?
ff is going to be so funny in this :)
thanks guys! @fluffyabsol @sazzbot are the maps better? bf1 maps were some of the worst in bf history
its just very disappointing that people who pay 20$ a month for origin access premium get to play the game 12days before someone who pre-ordered the game 90$ ca
@sacriel i have origins primer but dont see the option to play this now? it still shows 1 day 1 hour and 37 minutes before its available to play
dragoonseal going ham on that !access command saclol
game is actually live for origin access
@dragoonseal thanks!
is this the only map in the game kappa
the whale monkas
koillul
@nhaezer exactly. very disappointing
@thrills67 ea early access, so, yes ?
water looks ugly
i see approximately 0 support players?
@frozyeso exactly what i'm saying. most of those people will stop playing within the month and cancel their subscriptions
i guess you are in a server with this map only
ohhhh right
thank you @sleipnyr
remind me of karkand swimming back flank kappa
@superocrates medium settings
anyone have issues joining servers in bf1? curious if those problems would continue in bfv for me.
nhaezer probably
nhaezer when you cancel your subscription it asks for your feedback on why you did it, and the last option is "i subscribed for early access to a game" saclul
sac, remember you adjust your color blind settings so you can see the markers easier
do you keep progression ?
@lemings mmmm ham fragfood
@nhaezer pre-release used to be 3-4days max for ea, this 12days bullshit is ridiculous. especially when they promote their origin access membership above everything else
mkrar just subscribed with a tier 1 sub. mkrar subscribed for 37 months in a row! they said: good day to you lads | we salute you! sac7 sac7 sac7

@lemings i am actually thining about cancelling my deluxe preorder and just getting the origin access premier....
maybe they locked early access servers to beta maps?

@dragoonseal did they give a date?

@fluffyabsol not so poor now, voice acting is expensive lul
@snapper258 why you here then?
early access and a beta are kinda the same thing really
@lemings do you get smarter sachmm
this pre release thing is only for pc right?
snapper258 sounds to me you are just salty about the prerelease and have no idea how the game plays
i vote republican , will i like this game?
@charlie_is_my_dog i wouldn't know, sorry!
@frozyeso they know this is the only thing that could make people to take their shitty ea acess thingy xxxthx
yes
this is not on an rtx card, right?
!politics southernrebel88
southernrebel88, leave the politics, religion, or other heated subjects out of this chat. we do not want the discussions in here. thank you.
xbox too @aldoalladeen but xbox is tomorrow i think
@sacriel i have origins primer but dont see the option to play this now? it still shows 1 day 1 hour and 37 minutes before its available to play
i wonder if they just threw a rubber spider at the voice actors to get death screams.
sirrusc not really, i can't get it out of my head that my teacher looks like a dwarf from ironforge sacawk
im downloading my 10 hour trial right now i think everyone can play right now with ea access
can i play early if i pre order the normal version?
@dragoonseal np buddy
!rtx
bfv is not rtx enabled yet. sacriel is playing on the new nvidia rtx 2080ti!

there is a new nvidia driver for bfv
i hope the american voices are just as cheesy
@lemings lul saclul
@dragoonseal is sacriel still playing with medium quality (for better fps i think, i had to left the stream for a moment)
is that assault gun from the beta still broken
@sacriel someone on voice wanted to play with you. timpw
holy crap that spitfire fly by
@antiheroatx what about basic?
i think the 42nd tea is out on tarkov. anyone know?
@sleipnyr yeah he's on medium
pogchamp is performance better than beta? @sacriel
!bfv
@dragoonseal thanks
@fluffyabsol thanks
@sacriel unlock the shotgun
@carro_z well he had to turn down settings to medium, so hard to say
did that spitfire know to fly low for dramatic stream?
do i have to buy the game in order to play it for 10 hrs? @chat
anyone know the size of the download? 44gb for the trial doesn't seem like much?
sac is saving the lllladies.
@sacriel time to get the support's double barrel shotgun? the one with the rifle round in the bottom
sometinspecial just subscribed with twitch prime. sometinspecial subscribed for 8 months in a row! they said: almost missed hitting that sweet resub button. check your primes | we salute you! sac7 sac7 sac7
@muckeastwood origin access for the 10 hour trial.
i have drop
m-30 drilling i think it was called
@ミッチ well its only 8 maps now usually its 80 gigs after all dlc come out
sometinspecial sac7
@muckeastwood no, you need to have origin access, the basic version works
@ミッチ what do you mean by trial? if you mean the 10 hour trial you still need to download the full game
@lemings isn't that a triple barrel shotgun?
thought early access premier is nov 9th?
is this closed beta?
@ミッチ the game is 50gb-ish.
@nhaezer so the full game is only 44gb then...
mrsirundersteer sachmm
yea the triple barrel shotgun
@cprivy they moved it to today.
mmm yes, that drilling was fun in beta
@dragoonseal he had to reduce to medium with his monster of a pc? that doesn't sound promising ://
rip
!access
anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
44gb iirc
is firestorm not part of the launch? just wondering how well they pulled off battle royale
even the standard edition can be pre loaded tho
sounds just like a real headshot seemsgood
@lemings like, it had 2 shotgun barrels, and then the rifle barrel tucked between and below the 2 shotgun barrels
@ミッチ wouldn't call it "only" 44gb, but yea, that's it
chris121580 firestorm will be in march as far as i know
d. timpw
@hydroxcs mind you he's also streaming from this pc, and he was getting 144+ fps, he was just getting occasional drops
2 day is just every expesive day 2 play bfv 5 :d
the br comes out march
mrsirundersteer yeah but as a shotgun it only had 2 barrels...?

johnnyarks nope, stream and play on the same pc
@lemings if we're gonna get technical then technically, it's a multi caliber firearm, not a shotgun only, nor is it a rifle only. it's got both. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@mrsirundersteer its a side by side with a rifle barrel under the main barrels.
il hope there are interesting soundtracks like in battlefield 1

@blehmehandeh you could land planes in bf3/4 as well, so it would be weird if they didn't let you land planes on this title as well
planes had flares in ww2??
they should have included airfields in the game, so you can land to resupply and repair aircraft. bit silly being able to repair whilst flying

if you have premier but do not buy the deluxe edition, do you still get 6 paratroopers sets, deluxe special assignements and the weekly bonus items?
@idolen_ premier is today as well
best answer @sacriel u just questioned every word in the question xd
@microchaton yup
@idolen_ yes but i think it opened today as a surprise. don't think this is streamer specific
this map is dope
@bigtiddybawls feels like it, especially after the weekly reset. so many activities!
u.s. and u.k. i believe had a few differences in our codes as well back then
@madtown_maverick insane, so people get to play 1 week before actual supporters, for the development of the game.
skill gap is pretty high in this game compared to bf1. jackfrags had a lot of good things to say about the gameplay
@idolen_ i can play it as well and i don#t strema.
stream.
a = anton , b = berta , c = caesar, d = dora , e = emil @sacriel german phoenetics
@fluffyabsol yeah with premier
@idolen_ no anyone can get primeir or origin access
you only need origin premium access

i just did my premier account lul

there is repair in the air ahain in bf v?
@hobo lul
planes seem better to fly now
i thought they changed it to fly through something.
yes, but it's weaker
repair, it's in the name.
@trivialmind no, just in general, movement is slower paced. but it has different maps, whereas vermintide is always "go go go", otwd has some maps where it's just survive the horde

@trivialmind so it's not a straight comparison with vermintide. just the feeling i got watching it was that it was a slower-paced vermintide
i guess that's why we couldn't find him in the wild west, he was here the whole time
to add entertainment to the twitch cheers system you can now play a sound on stream with any cheers over 500! simply type "cheer500 [soundname] message" to play your sound on the stream. replace the word soundname with any of the sounds from http://sacriel.tv/cheersboard/ eg. "cheer500 [carcrash] message" then sit back and enjoy!

how good/bad is the game so far?
what does that mean lol ?
if you have origin access then yeah you can play it already
so i am completly out of the loop here, doesn't bfv release on 20th??

makes sense, dont need to parralel park a plane, heyoo...
@arrayarc it's literately called hdr in the options. and it's been in games for like 10 years. it's not as good as the true hdr you can get from monitors that support it these days, it's just an aproximation of the effect. never looks particularly great, some games do it better than others

@sgt_cracker coming in march
danyes
it sounds like the females talk way more but tahts just me
love it
looks great map
its cute
it's nice and green.
thank you kanye, very cool!
seems great to me
revive takes a long time
@sacriel when i've been shot a good pat on the shoulder is all i need to get back in the fray! :d
sturm!!
!bfv
cool map!! how many maps are there?
battlefield: v is the next battlefield game set in europe during ww2. cleaner ui, more teamwork and an even more interactive map set bf:v apart. https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-5
yeah map looks great
this map looks great
is this the map from the first trailer ?
looks good
is raytracing just working?
all the vegetation makes it look a bit bad on stream
the smg gunplay looks weird like a wobbly balloon animal
looks like shreks swamp
i love the map so far...making me actually want to run out and get this when i was hoping to wait until later before
@scottmey2001 that’s squad revive not a normal revive
seems great. amazing how an "open map" seems to have a lot of cover
this is more the bf maps this game is suited for
map feels like river somme
@gigglz 8 now, more coming later
@padaroxon not yet
maps is pretty but the layout is really bad
i'm glad they added that revive mechanic in the game, i hated when people would die in bf1 and bf4 where people would just respawn where there was obviously medics nearby
lul
@melkor985 it is
deleted facts
do medics still only have smg's and no dmr's? @sacriel
downloading ......
@mirnic9801 gotcha, ty
@dasquared i k r? i was like.. i can wait until the 20th... yeah.. not gonna happen lol
@ryanmakhoul ty
@soderhoolm take it elsewhere.

i like how sac just puts a u in reticle :p
@sacriel it is made for the shape of a tank

bracket target in center piece
maybe it's for when you're on a hill and it's to aim when the camera is tilted @sacriel
size of tank.? to judge distance?
seqfeels
when an enemy tank matches the silhouette youhave the right range
i think the middle thingy is "tank standing towards you" as the center
derp gun
clap
that thing is meant to destroy structures 😡
its a picture of a bunker you use it like mill dots if somone is 2 bunkers away you shoot at their feet kappa
range markers on the right windage built in

it looks like an oldschool artellery
@sacriel have to line it up with the tank's shoulders.
@fambaa oh yea that makes sense
if the zeroing is accurate, i don't think it's a bad reticule

@dexsleik it is the worlds most powerful console, its just shit
colony92 yea they changed it totally on surprise today
@mulface no the beta is over but the game is out early on pc
@teresmajor one is i think, a bolt rifle
@colony92 they moved it to today.
@sacriel type “lul” (as in the twitch emote lul ) in to google. the auto detect translation is hilarious.. 😂
clearly not 4head
@comatose24 isn't release on 16?
@wallytreats its premier tho
5 years, not 6
@adrianbrown sweet, i got one irl, i didnt expect them to add it in this game though
coolmusicguy yea full normal reelease is that day, but ea access peeps get it early
back out
@sacriel how do you predict the launch will do?
@jarmoest ah gotcha, ok gg ya got me
wait this is full release lol a whole 2 weeks early huh
still can't swap teams..?
@shannonzkiller oh thank god! i was so bored with games... was waint gfor tomorrow! colonyhype
lol no team switching :d
you could switch in the beta right?
it encourages teaming up before the game and discourages just team swapping to the winning team
try to invite him through origin

@iyield2no1 sac7
@iyield2no1 sac7
is this full release or just late beta?
you can switch teams if you have a friend on the other i side i heard the devs say in a stream
"that's a bad feature..." - battlefield, the series!
that map looked beautiful
@s0journer full release
cyb00rg two weeks early... but technically still two weeks late. originally they said the game was going to be out late october
team switching has always been a bf issue..
biker
so im guessing no team balance?
!access
anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
i think to make up for it they should add the option to choose a preferred faction.
@s0journer full
i think it's an understandable change
it makes sense to remove it but you need a way to join with friends
team switching is a huge problem in bf1, thank god
!42nd
they should make it so it only restricts changing to the winning team. people on the winning team can still swap to the losing one
the 42nd comes from chris' youtube name sacriel42. the 42 comes from the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy. when the community here started to get bigger we chose to call ourselves the 42nd. read more here: http://sacriel.tv/the-42nd/
@s0journer tomorrow is official full release
c'mon sac.. that makes to much sense.. sheesh
is he playing with stod?
sacriel always got a solution lol

sac your such a captain heinsight lol

sick and tired of br its a good thing they delay it
is bfv worth the money?
not sure on that unicornbrothels
origin premier is actual worth btw if you're gonna play more than 1 origin game

@uzziuri $100 dollars a year and i already have 2 deluxe versions of games worth 70+ dollars? that's worth.
@shannonzkiller when are you guys moving into the new place?
there’s so many people asking how he’s playing this game right now, i feel there should be a banner on the bottom of the screen to explain lul
hello sacwave
if you want to say it like a 'murican, you gotta say "car-bean"

doobyscoo $20 says you haven't even played the game other than maybe the beta, how the hell can you say it's lacking content? it has more than bf1 and that did just fine

@steppenwolf549 deception kappa
@fluidextractor yeah im downloading right now too
is it really really bfv? aww mann yeah!

vaulting barbed wire. timpw
im so excited for this game! i have to wait until full release though
yea not having the battle royale for 5 months is a mistake i think
@ionone medium
my only issue with battlefield is every match is always one sided
is this just a bit of wood nailed to some steel?
medium.
so i already own battlefield 5 deluxe edition, can i buy premier to play today anyways ?
medium graphics i believe
can you hide in a grass or in a bush in this game properly?
funny you hook up to a static line then also do an animation for pulling a parachute

jesus chat today is a fucking mess
!access blue_fist75 it came out early mate
blue_fist75, anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.
does sac have raytracing enabled?
@lemings the poor lack of communication and misleading information. also the very negative response they got from the general public and fans of the game.
i have a question about origin premium... do you have to buy the game to play early or by just paying the monthly amount you get the game?
hilfe !!!!!
get some bombs dude
put them on a and d
destroy the objectives :d
has there been good changes since the last beta?
@dragoonseal well i have premier and i didint get it
@ponssek you only get to play early if you own it
this doesnt look very fun
@dragoonseal ah thats good, literally the betas best gun haha

i’m out of the loop. did this game fail as bad as everyone was saying it would?
tarkov- fresh wipe... you down @sacriel
who is playing with a kazoo?
this feelin any different?
i promise i will play medic!!!!!!
boil em mash em stick em in a stew
@miseryarse we saw you and therefore you are and will stay as a stream sniper in our books forever. no matter what you do kappa lul
i love maps without vehicles
cheer100
lol
is it only me or the arm model looks so strange?
!squad
sacriel is currently playing with stodeh.
did i hear a fart sound? lol
i'd play medic - my aim isn't the best
stodeh probs plays with a kazoo.
vicious_dude sac7
doobyscoo lack of communication? no idea what you mean, they said a bunch of things about the game beforehand. misleading information? you mean people wanting something, expecting it as confirmed, then when the game comes out and it's not in because the devs never said anything like it they are butthurt? negative response from the general public? you mean those kids shouting -banned word- based on the very first trailer like some 10years olds?
@miseryarse sacclassy sacbros
that was a quick round
whats wrong with medic guns?
@vicious_dude sac7
po ta toes
i play medic usually did they nerf them or something?
@andreah2o i hate every vehicle lul
our cq server just crashed
or give medic better guns?
fluffyabsol lol
no more run and gun smoketvrip
i bet you can build them
@sacriel how are you liking the new battlefield so far? think it was worth the delay?
its a bit odd to me when it moves, invictusaie
oh wth
you can build stations
gj dice
play a support like a medic to win not kill...
@jizzsocks best. name. on. twitch. 😂
so the medic guns are peashooters basicly?
@sacriel instead of "das ist zwei helfen" it's "das sind zwei gesundheit"
high preset kreygasm
i will be nnpm: never not playing medic
this is my oath
thats battlefield... if they had great guns then everyone would play a medic....
@sacriel squad leaders can drop in resupply capsules
maa drains ur fps
did they nerf the sten from the beta? cause you could do alroght at mid range with that
hacksaw ridge it and don'tt use a gun
@lemings preach. timplove
@lemings it wasnt mislead information it just wasnt what we expected or wanted from the next entry in the bf franchise especially given the fact ww2 is a pretty sentitive atmosphere to just completely change.
looks a lot better
wait what? battlefiled is out??? wut? lirikhmm lirikthink lirikp
are there performance issues?
they gave assults battle rifles or somethign stupid didnt they
same map different mode?

@the_seventh lol why does lirik have so many thinking emotes
@lobnob_ there is not nvidia driver yet so does it matter?
don't tar me as a stream sniper - as soon as i realised i was in their server i quit. certainly wasn't intentional - there arent that many servers to go on with a low ping
center chest like john wick
@sacriel check motion blur settings, make sure it didn't turn back on
center chest is better
@shannonzkiller i think sac is doing gangnam, again.
can you turn on fps counter?
coffee is way better than tea. can't change my mind kappa
rtx off feelsbadman
fluffyabsol oh god... old school
sounds is 10/10
so... hiding in a ditch?
@sacriel special forces kind of keep it flat to their stomach if they're clearing buildings
@pecky95 i just got the nvidia drivers
complaining about realism in a viddy game is pretty silly imo. not everything has to be a simulation
cynicalfps
@lemings there were multipule occasions when they said things would or wouldnt be at launch and it was the opposite. there have been so many negative things about the game so far.
@sacriel turn off maa
how to play it today?
winterwolfeu sensitive atmosphere? so what about those many games which covered ww2 in the past? cod2, bf1942, day of infamy. those weren't magically cried about for being ww2
oof
darkpuppet97 i am with you. tbh.
62 on a monster rig wutface
62 feelsbadman
@pykseldot yeah but its just more of the fact every ww2 game so far has had pretty much the same atmosphere, going against that with such an iconic game that would fit the era is just weird.
rtx on btw lul
vsync monkas
you gots dat rtx on?
@lobnob_ y and it might make the game run so much better that whatever is happening for him does not matter
@kleiklei got me.. no idea.:d ... q for him :-) do you know how sac playing b5 already? beta or what?
oh nice
vsync terrible input lag dansgame
kreygasm
my favorite ww2 documantaries are the two newer wolfenstien games

@sacriel rtx on?
@winterwolfeu i don't disagree that i was hoping they would go more modern with the franchise for this next installment but that doesn't immediately make it a bad game.
that’s nice
much better
@lemings world at war was in the thick of wwii and nobody complained. cynicaldead
@shaddydashadow he has vsync off. just has the fps capped is all
darkpuppet97 my favourite types are usually rich espresso blends. i like a slightly coocay flavour
lul
i would have liked to see modern as well, but im not toooo mad about the ww2 setting and taking some liberties with it
what is this fight lul
@dragoonseal he just turned it off?
doobyscoo if there are so many, then tell me what! give me examples! they said vehicle visual customization won't be in at launch, and lo and behold, it's not in
sackill
how can he play now? premier gets it at 5 pm tommorow?
fluffyabsol yeah exactly
@lemings not to mention the boring single player
@lemings cod2 bf1942 never went to the "lesser" known battles and decided to make the battlefield consist of 50% females or completely skip d-day. bfv skipping d-day completely for what purpose? showing narvik and norway's involvement?
@shaddydashadow he never turned it on
@nuugi i quit as soonn as i realised i was in their server didn't real;ise till i heard my name and then quit immediatley.

is bfv out? :o
doobyscoo black ops 4 has no singleplayer, i don't see people boycotting it because of it
only snipers can spot right ?
@dragoonseal dunno just saw him in the settings and it was on and saw him turn it off
is this a us loadout playing german?
eh singleplayer isn't that bad, gives the people who are terrible at multiplayer some practice at least
is it me or do the animations look cheap
!access @kobbz
kobbz, anyone with origin access premier can play bfv now. restart origin if you don't see the option.

only with certain scopes @melkor985 and support can by surpressing with a specific kit
cod was never campaign oriented though. dice never pulled off a decent campaign
@lspn you're watching him play, right? :)
@flusha_lmao compared to what?
hey guys do you think your enemy should drop the health pack if he has one when he dies?
1hp pog
@winterwolfeu you know that this is time-line based, right? america isn't in the game, yet.
@nuugi no checking lists when i sign in 3 times its put me back in their game i'm quitting each time. might wait till later to play as it's an issue
@lemings thats a different game and it has a battle royale. i'm saying the single player in this game that they used resources on is rubbish
ja, why not
42 hp
@pecky95 bf1
@shaddydashadow when it put it on the high preset it reset some options like motion blur and such, that he turned back off again. i didn't see if vsync was one of them.
first and last medic in the world
@comatose24 yes, but on origin it says in 1 day, countdown on origin
winterwolfeu so what? you some incel or something? it's an alternate history, get over it. and nobody said they will miss d-day. this is early in the war, d-day was a lot later. and it will most likely be in later on as part of the tides of war
@fluffyabsol extremely unlikely that d-day is in the game given the fact it hasnt been marketed or even mentioned despite being one of the most iconic moments in history.
ha,
@dragoonseal oh ok i just joined in at that moment so lol
nasty!
its an ultra rare shiny medic
@winterwolfeu so i guess you never played the first cod ;d of course it was campaign based
@sacriel new eft patch and wipe today, you gonna be jumping into it again this wipe?
@miseryarse welcome to the twitch (chat) lul
how do you think the m1a1 carbine handles @sacriel
wups
*flop*
that was a great pistol head shot when you turned that corner
go sniper?
@lemings it takes just a quick scroll through any battlefield youtubers videos to see all the problems.
if you're not a medic, you don't get to complain about there being no medics, imo
i like this map wasnt this one in the beta?
@winterwolfeu they haven't marketed any american involvement, yet.
beta??
@lemings it was never marketed as alternate history, it was marketed as showing the lesser known "facts" of the war. youre calling me an incel over the internet on a twitch chat? i wonder who's one lmao hostile much
so crap??
i've always liked the word carbine. satisfying word.
@sacriel early release?
@doobyscoo so you're basing your feedback on heresay, thereby propagating the problem.
d-day has been done to death, who cares. i'd rather do something different
uhhh the garand
could you have picked a less important thing to arge about? good lord get lives.
@winterwolfeu it was marked as their take on ww2
winterwolfeu lemings cmon guys..
marketed*
so the changes they made from beta, how are they?
@nuugi been a member for a while now lol
this gun seems really weak
not everyone wants to relive their childhood until the end of time
thst looks sick if you get in cover
@connatic id love a dday operation..
so many
buy or nay?
@connatic so because the initial cods were campaign based over a decade ago that makes the entire franchise invested in it? the multiplayer has been the go to selling point for many many years, skipping a campaign was a decision they made because it wasnt profitable to keep based on the past 3 entries.
holy shit
@sacriel do you think the enemy should drop the health pack they have when they die, that could solve the low heath issue a bit
that animation was... odd
the movement system makes firefights way more interesting
saclul sacbros
winterwolfeu no, it was marketed as "showing the lesser known battles of ww2". don't change facts to your advantage. and yes, in general only those people have this obsession against women
@connatic would you rather have call of duty gameplay with silly little jetpacks and too futuristic shits
don't make mommy shannon separate you.
this girl screams wutface
@shannonzkiller im arguing about a point he's just insulting me lmao
lol winterwolf is so mad about viddy games
@typehazard i think they do?
how is he able to play 1 day before release?? strreamerthing?
sorry i have not been here for a long time. hello @sacriel mods and chat vissh

@winterwolfeu you said never campaign based. just correcting you.
no arguing about the game. take it to reddit
so the game came out

@lemings im an incel :) now fight me lul lul

@rocketmunkey i havent seen it happen yet, all he has picked up from fallen enemies is ammo
hey @dragoonseal hi
@connatic @winterwolfeu take it to whipsers please, or else move on and enjoy watching the gameplay.
@dragoonseal thanks mate ^^
oh wow you're actually able to fix your plane and turn now
have the flying mechanics been improved since the beta?
wait wasnt this place in post scriptum as well?
@caseysbro what are you talking about? just saying, every ww2 game doesn't have to be about d-day
cheer10 is the flight control similar to battlefield 1 or battlefield 3/4 ?
@ryanmakhoul they added a campaign to try to compete with other shooters that pulled off decent campaigns at the time (modern warfare 2, black ops 1) but never succeeded with a very well received one
@sacriel how's the flying feel? i would imagine not changed much from previous incarnations.
why do people argue just stop and watch the game nobody will gain anything from this
fly through the bridge
wow the controversy over what timeline or weather its gonna show d-day this game looks sick and i just wanna play it, leave all your arguing at the door and just watch the epic game play
ow.
the flak is real
winterwolfeu we have a rule against arguing especially over controversial crap and politics. best suited to reddit, thanks! lemings, leave the insults out. you know better sacno
@typehazard i thought he'd picked up a couple, but maybe they were ammo packs and i'm a blindo
the plane shooting blanks or what
hey chat is this an early release @sacriel

@atraaaax sac7
some of you need to scream into a bucket, or something. timpw
isn't it progressing through the war chronologically but taking liberties with weapons and equipment? so we're at 1939/40 now meaning a d-day map may come once we get round to 1944 in the freelc?
what are the flares for?
@connatic more of technicalities. multiplayer wasnt really a thing in 2002 lol
shannonzkiller okay mom sacthump i need to finish my ramen and get to class soon anyways sacawk

wow ur flying at mk 4 or something

@winterwolfeu last 3 had lackluster campaign, they skipped this one, then why are you guys boycotting bfv for adding a campaign and saying it "sucks"

if you have the deluxe version preordered, ive been told you can sign up for premiere, play early, cancel, and all your stats and progress carries over to the version you already own
pestimism you dont need to buy the game, just have acess for 12
doesnt premier bf release tomrow?

graphical downgrade from bf1
@topguyz its like they are a business or something
thats good. not op that way
supports carrying tank shells saclul
@bahoney it realeased day early
no tank camp, i'm ok with it xd
@came_too_quick lul
tatt support which can carry tank ammo should get a medal :p
no this is better, tanks are op in other bf's
@majorfoley yea the 4 didn't have an 88 but there is a later model with a longer barrel
@sacriel maybe try supply drop? from the plane
what about the supply drop thing you did earlier?
@came_too_quick wut?
@killerkadoffel nah it did say panzer 4 so i am gonna assume the anti infantry models back before they gave em longer barrels
i like it. i like attrition and ammo not being as prevalent
it's destroyed
it's dead, sac.
build the station
need to build station
@sacriel might need to repair the station as a support
its not built
people defending ea in chat lul
is this with rtx??
yeah i like it too @bloodba7h
thanks, just confused. it says 9th november
lol i just saw they added your tea in tarkov lul
@originaltimeline yeah the tigers were the original tanks with 88s and i think the panzer 3s had 76s didnt they? early pivs were infantry support tanks
camping tanks with unlimited ammo in 2018 lul

@pestimism "ea bad"
"defending ea" over game-mechanics, ok dude

d:
i did know that ;) @fluffyabsol
sac just farted on that guy.
dickhead? d: rude
how can he play already?
can you steal enemy tanks in this game?
how is he able to play today? i have premier and i cant play
bouche4dag they took like 5-6 direct hit tank shots before they got destroyed
no destruction is a bf notlikethis
@lemings they were blown up super quick in the beta :o

sips has been online for 1 hour, 27 minutes, and 40 seconds..
you lose money when you get "busted" anyway
hi sips and chat :)
stop getting bounties then kappa
i pay off all of my bounties and i still have $2000+
take a shit get a bounty
"animal cruelty"
you kicked a dog
don't kick a dog first
stop running
do it before you commit a crime lol
you knocked a dog
if you surrender, they take the bounty's worth out of your wallet anyway
@zevonfb lul
lol i never have bountys
so it go reported
put mask on until sheriff's office
take your pants off as you surrender brokeback
!peta
go in to the city from the other side, streight to the seriff
https://clips.twitch.tv/swissflacciddragonfruitpermasmug
dont kick a dog this time
@sips_ if u run away they start shooting
"stupid reasons" kills ppl and kicks dogs lul
why not go in the town on the jail side?
stop playing so bad and you wont get a bounty
you kicked a dog lul
pick your nose get a bounty
ffs
ericanunoo just subscribed for 10 months in a row!
its ok to have a little bounty. i always pay mine off eventually
the whole witness/wanted stuff in the middle of nowhere is incredibly ludicrous. in the middle of nowhere and suddenly lawmen spawn out of nowhere? works in gta, not here
sneak in to the sheriff's office
don't kick a dog first!
but then i don't go around kicking dogs, running people over and shooting people
lol
sips_ if you talk to the sherrif when the crime is reported you can get away with
"you get a bounty for the dumbest reasons" commiting violent crimes = dumb reason
they told you to stop, you didnt, then they started shooting
just walk in and dont do anything
shouldn't have kicked that dog!
!peta
@sips_ if you have your mask on maybe they won't recognise you
walk in without your horse
@sips_ wear masks?
you have to stand still on foot to surrender @sips_
the debutys see you and start shooting
well you did kick a dog
stop moving
this time consider not kicking the dog. consider it
fart $300 bounty
don't kick a dog first
walk slowly @sips_
put mask on until you get in sheriff's office
you kicked a dog
stop moving
before you kick a dog
he says "don't move"
the minute i stomp all over this dog
every 2 weeks the person with the most dicks gets to win some merch! rules are at https://sipsco.net/stream/ under the 'prize!' tab!
commits crime -why the fuck do i always get bounties? ->flees sherrif -why cant i just surrender
you kicked the dog
you did kick the dog
don't go into town and commit a crime
well, stop being a murdering psychopathic menace who kicks dogs. there might be some sort of connection ^^
it is very hit and miss.
surrender only works on lower bounties
wanted -donate all money to camp moneysink -sleep in clink for free, no bounty paid - free man
but it was a good dog kick tho'
if you change your outfit or your hair, they won't recognize you.
you are though
pjsalt pjsalt pjsalt
no kappa
you are though lul
you kinda are wrong though
yes you are
@sips_ dont ride fast with your horse into town
you are though
maybe you are too dumb to understand ?
yes you are
lul
when you stop kicking dogs
call lester via telegram to get rid of your wanted level
@sips_ target a lawmen and press y
you could just stop kicking dogs
clap
yes you are :d
im not wrong
you really are
to surrender
you are just bad at games
the system does need a rework
masks dont hide your identity
lul
you did surrender successfully once before by stealing from the drawers in the sheriff's
sips_ you're playing the mechanics wrong i'm afraid
it's okay dad i forgive you
this game was made by some fucking doglovers or something
you committed a crime in valentine that's why they came after you, not that you had a bounty
won't they take his guns though?
just surrender 4head
masks are basically useless
stop being a bad person ingame then :<
"a little too sensitive" says the guy who shoots people on sight for laughing at his hat?
i feel the same way with my government sips
it still works better than gta v
disagree
you're not hiding yourself and managing witnesses properly to avoid bounties
guys he literally walked into town the first time and was immediately shot at stop agitating him
sips "im not wrong"

if u dont run u can surrender
just walk into the sheriff
its not a money issue.

more oxygen in the atmosphere

they were really short so they could breathe the safe ground air
they used to be bigger
they were different but yes
crocs older than dinos
there was more oxygen in the air right?
feelsbadman can't anyone see my messages
@sips_ there was more oxygen in the atmosphere
crocodilians are older than dinosaurs

@metathiax yeah
what about "cuisses de grenouille" monsieur @sips_ ?
hi :3
use a human as bait
we we're promised fishin
@carniz oh shit you right
the oxygen theory was thought to be the reason, but recently it was proved that the air is not to blame. can’t remember much else but that ain’t it chief.
yes they have. they basically stopped evolving millions of years ago because they min/maxed into an op build
feed me to the gators

the war of 1812 was a conflict fought between the united states, the united kingdom, and their respective allies from june 1812 to february 1815. historians in britain often see it as a minor theater of the napoleonic wars; in the united states and canada, it is seen as a war in its own right.
