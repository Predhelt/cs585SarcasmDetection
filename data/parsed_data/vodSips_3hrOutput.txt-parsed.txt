sips should go legendary hunting since he loves hunting so much tbh
you can tame and sell horses but it’s not worth it
@currymcflurry123 if you save after pushing the button to pick up the gold bar but before he does it and reload it adds it to your inventory and leaves it in the world to do again and again
@usmcthomasw he doesnt dead eye to hunt so itll be hard :p

@zelaesh a direct comparison of inflation doesn
you have to discover it first and travelling for hours can destroy a game. best have the option and allow players to explore when in the mood.

if you bounty is low enough, you can sometimes simply surrender to the nearest lawman before things escalate by targeting them and pressing y or triangle to surrender, and putting away your weapons. you'll spend a few in-game days in jail, and the fine will be paid automatically.

pay it at the post office
you have to stop moving!
@nosbig11, dont need to pay if you sleep in the clink
even tho your broke lul
go to the post office
because turning yourself in every 6h as arthur morgan does make a lot of sense right? since you are an outlaw

if u run they shoot u for running so u cant surrender
speak to the sheriff

frankerz ralpherz corgiderp

he just needs to fucking stop moving
before they start shooting
i've stood there, not moving, not armed and they trounce me and kill me. it is bs. yes you can pay for it, but you should be able to hand yourself in aswell. geez.
maybe if u stop running away
i blame the dog for being so kickable

@sips_ if you bounty is low enough, you can sometimes simply surrender to the nearest lawman before things escalate by targeting them and pressing y or triangle to surrender, and putting away your weapons. you'll spend a few in-game days in jail, and the fine will be paid automatically.

why not go in the town on the jail side?
stop playing so bad and you wont get a bounty
you kicked a dog lul
pick your nose get a bounty
ffs
ericanunoo just subscribed for 10 months in a row!
its ok to have a little bounty. i always pay mine off eventually
the whole witness/wanted stuff in the middle of nowhere is incredibly ludicrous. in the middle of nowhere and suddenly lawmen spawn out of nowhere? works in gta, not here
sneak in to the sheriff's office
don't kick a dog first!
but then i don't go around kicking dogs, running people over and shooting people
lol
sips_ if you talk to the sherrif when the crime is reported you can get away with
"you get a bounty for the dumbest reasons" commiting violent crimes = dumb reason
they told you to stop, you didnt, then they started shooting
just walk in and dont do anything
shouldn't have kicked that dog!
!peta
@sips_ if you have your mask on maybe they won't recognise you
walk in without your horse
@sips_ wear masks?
you have to stand still on foot to surrender @sips_
the debutys see you and start shooting
well you did kick a dog
stop moving
this time consider not kicking the dog. consider it
fart $300 bounty
don't kick a dog first
walk slowly @sips_
put mask on until you get in sheriff's office
you kicked a dog
stop moving
before you kick a dog
he says "don't move"

every 2 weeks the person with the most dicks gets to win some merch! rules are at https://sipsco.net/stream/ under the 'prize!' tab!
commits crime -why the fuck do i always get bounties? ->flees sherrif -why cant i just surrender
you kicked the dog
you did kick the dog
don't go into town and commit a crime
well, stop being a murdering psychopathic menace who kicks dogs. there might be some sort of connection ^^
it is very hit and miss.
surrender only works on lower bounties
wanted -donate all money to camp moneysink -sleep in clink for free, no bounty paid - free man
but it was a good dog kick tho'
if you change your outfit or your hair, they won't recognize you.
you are though
pjsalt pjsalt pjsalt
no kappa
you are though lul
you kinda are wrong though
yes you are
@sips_ dont ride fast with your horse into town
you are though
maybe you are too dumb to understand ?
yes you are
lul
when you stop kicking dogs
call lester via telegram to get rid of your wanted level
@sips_ target a lawmen and press y
you could just stop kicking dogs
clap
yes you are :d
im not wrong
you really are
to surrender
you are just bad at games
the system does need a rework
masks dont hide your identity
lul
you did surrender successfully once before by stealing from the drawers in the sheriff's
sips_ you're playing the mechanics wrong i'm afraid
it's okay dad i forgive you
this game was made by some fucking doglovers or something
you committed a crime in valentine that's why they came after you, not that you had a bounty
won't they take his guns though?
just surrender 4head
masks are basically useless
stop being a bad person ingame then :<
"a little too sensitive" says the guy who shoots people on sight for laughing at his hat?
i feel the same way with my government sips
it still works better than gta v
disagree
you're not hiding yourself and managing witnesses properly to avoid bounties
guys he literally walked into town the first time and was immediately shot at stop agitating him

@metathiax yeah
what about "cuisses de grenouille" monsieur @sips_ ?
hi :3
use a human as bait
we we're promised fishin
@carniz oh shit you right
the oxygen theory was thought to be the reason, but recently it was proved that the air is not to blame. can’t remember much else but that ain’t it chief.
yes they have. they basically stopped evolving millions of years ago because they min/maxed into an op build

the war of 1812 was a conflict fought between the united states, the united kingdom, and their respective allies from june 1812 to february 1815. historians in britain often see it as a minor theater of the napoleonic wars; in the united states and canada, it is seen as a war in its own right.
