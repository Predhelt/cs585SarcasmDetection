Nothing like spending time with a group of people you have never been introduced to, and feeling like they are family right off the bat. They had some great stories to share, and we all got a free health check-up

[11/10/18, 10:23:56 AM] <Beliskner666> @Flexibilty It actually is, nearly doubling the voice acting is expensive

[11/10/18, 10:37:03 AM] <solipsist1> cohhDerp
[11/10/18, 10:37:03 AM] <owlshark> Arthur had like 5k if l remember right, does that mean sadie would kill Arthur?
[11/10/18, 10:37:03 AM] <scalco65> is there a difference between being wanted and having a bounty?
[11/10/18, 10:37:03 AM] <judostar25> 5k ish
[11/10/18, 10:37:06 AM] <SirSneakyy> 5k bounty for arthur
[11/10/18, 10:37:07 AM] <Dwaallicht> you could remake rdr1 for that bounty money
[11/10/18, 10:37:08 AM] <Rooster2400> i thought it was 1200
[11/10/18, 10:37:08 AM] <dev_box> 5 dorrars x 1000
[11/10/18, 10:37:08 AM] <Vatinius> probably more than 5k at this point, considering all the things they did
[11/10/18, 10:37:10 AM] <schloopitydoop> @cohhcarnage did you buy the new shotgun?
[11/10/18, 10:37:11 AM] <Glitchedgeometry> Is it still $7 a person?
[11/10/18, 10:37:14 AM] <Miklagard> @Janus32 I imagine they all got the same bounty
