[11/23/18, 8:04:10 PM] <SarahWhereIsMyTea> @Nathillon wait.. I thought they said that the damage is fine, they just gonna fix the animation so othar players cant hit the enemy while shaman bites him
[11/23/18, 8:04:35 PM] <simpliv> Shaman pounce should/probably is needing stamina cost

[11/23/18, 8:04:49 PM] <Nathillon> @SarahWhereIsMyTea Is that what it is? Knew there was a nerf to pounce, wasn't sure what it was. Heard damage mostly.
[11/23/18, 8:04:52 PM] <simpliv> Currently too strong to be a free move without stamina
[11/23/18, 8:04:52 PM] <Vanillastein> @rumblymarrow woopsHey

[11/23/18, 8:05:47 PM] <VirtuallyNonExistent> Shaman pounce not only doesn't cost Stamina it regens it to max when it lands

[11/23/18, 8:08:40 PM] <VirtuallyNonExistent> Lots of characters need damage buffs except the devs think the game as a whole needs less damage being thrown about so fights don't end instantly because both of these can be true at the same time LUL
[11/23/18, 8:08:44 PM] <simpliv> It's kind of ironic, LB's weapon is basically as long as nobushi's spear but he's lucky to hit 2 pikemen in a heavy

[11/23/18, 8:09:38 PM] <TrueFenix> they wont fix it because it works against cheesy spam
[11/23/18, 8:09:41 PM] <CONUcleation> that was mean
[11/23/18, 8:09:47 PM] <minedixer> I think the guy had a perk that gives him revenge when he hits you
[11/23/18, 8:09:49 PM] <TrueFenix> however, lawbringer can literally only spam push into light so

[11/23/18, 8:24:05 PM] <Vanillastein> Yeah, that's why I stopped watching a lot of Rollplay. Couldn't stand shows never getting to late game. FeelsRainMan

[11/23/18, 8:24:19 PM] <gibbonobo> but then why is court of swords still up
[11/23/18, 8:24:22 PM] <endwell> same
[11/23/18, 8:24:23 PM] <Kilik_> Long form rpg shows are hard to keep a consistent audience
[11/23/18, 8:24:24 PM] <LordXaras> I enjoyed the Warhammer one-shot Adam ran

[11/23/18, 8:24:27 PM] <Boytokyotwitch> Is this game crashing at load screen for anyone?
[11/23/18, 8:24:27 PM] <locien0> @Strippin We need you in a warhammer 40k show, something as Rogue Trader would allow lots of freedom
[11/23/18, 8:24:31 PM] <Nobleprinceps> That JP. He's just like EA. stripOhno itmejpMAD
[11/23/18, 8:24:33 PM] <baneblood> @Strippin maybe you could host your own, not saying u GM exactly, but host it on ur channel
[11/23/18, 8:24:34 PM] <lusobr> I like longer games
[11/23/18, 8:24:41 PM] <lusobr> one shots don't get me invested
[11/23/18, 8:24:42 PM] <Vanillastein> How far did they get in Court of Swords? Ain't watched any of it.
[11/23/18, 8:24:47 PM] <Inkanobi> @Strippin SCP One0shot? Think about it
[11/23/18, 8:24:49 PM] <HiroYuchi> I don't really like any of the shows they've got going right now

[11/23/18, 8:25:03 PM] <MorwenTivele> is this Wardruna?
[11/23/18, 8:25:05 PM] <Plan_A_Has_Failed> Need to talk JP into another RollPlay show
[11/23/18, 8:25:05 PM] <HiroYuchi> Oddballs is great though
[11/23/18, 8:25:08 PM] <bassemandrh> Wasn't nebula jazz long form?
[11/23/18, 8:25:08 PM] <Velot> A World of Warcraft DND long form campaign to coincide with Classic launch would be amazing.
[11/23/18, 8:25:09 PM] <Gamblez118> @Strippin as somone who would like to play WOW i feel like i have missed way too much, do you think WOW classic could be a good way to get in to it?
[11/23/18, 8:25:10 PM] <TheArgentGod> jesse's getting into doing role play, so maybe do with him
[11/23/18, 8:25:11 PM] <Nefarious_Sloth> talk to Joe. he has been talking about doing more RP and DnD
[11/23/18, 8:25:12 PM] <gibbonobo> maybe once oddballs ends?
[11/23/18, 8:25:14 PM] <Vanillastein> @Plan_A_Has_Failed But he'd just cancel it. PepeHands
[11/23/18, 8:25:17 PM] <gibbonobo> there'd be an opening?

[11/23/18, 8:25:21 PM] <Plan_A_Has_Failed> He hasn't cancelled CoS yet
[11/23/18, 8:25:22 PM] <opticalmouse100> Warhammer is a hard one for him though because that had a huge following before with TB and all of them
[11/23/18, 8:25:23 PM] <Edonran> @MorwenTivele yup
[11/23/18, 8:25:26 PM] <LordXaras> Are you into Magic? I know Adam has been thinking of starting a Ravnica D&D game
[11/23/18, 8:25:28 PM] <lusobr> Jesse has two shows right now one of which he is running
[11/23/18, 8:25:34 PM] <lusobr> don't think he has time to do another one
[11/23/18, 8:25:43 PM] <Nekros4442> Is Sam robotic to anyone else?
[11/23/18, 8:25:47 PM] <gibbonobo> i feel like court of swords deserves to be the long form one
[11/23/18, 8:25:48 PM] <Darkaros> Oddballs is (advertised as) having a rotating cast, so maybe when Octo and pals die
[11/23/18, 8:25:48 PM] <Vanillastein> @Nekros4442 no. woopsSip
[11/23/18, 8:25:53 PM] <Plan_A_Has_Failed> Sounds fine to me, Nekros

[11/23/18, 8:26:28 PM] <FragmentShader> Dark_Sight Sunfall? that's been great, ye
[11/23/18, 8:26:29 PM] <leovic1> Jesse's show is horrific in the eldritch horror kind of way (meaning really good)
[11/23/18, 8:26:37 PM] <opticalmouse100> I've always wanted to play an rpg where you were basically given a base/village and had to level it up and adventure out from it
[11/23/18, 8:26:39 PM] <Darkaros> That's just classic Steven though
[11/23/18, 8:26:43 PM] <KingBendrick> how dope would a nuzlocke pokemon dnd be

[11/23/18, 8:27:47 PM] <Vanillastein> @Nathillon Yes it does. You can't hide 3 core rulebooks of required reading. woopsS
[11/23/18, 8:27:53 PM] <67TrianglesInARow> I think the game is still too easy, so perma faint doesn't really matter
[11/23/18, 8:27:53 PM] <Altiar900> Took out JJs knee caps just now LUL
[11/23/18, 8:27:56 PM] <KingBendrick> yeah thats nuzlocke

[11/23/18, 8:28:06 PM] <Sluggs_> its kind of hard to lose a pokemon though
[11/23/18, 8:28:06 PM] <KingBendrick> makes it way more fun to me
[11/23/18, 8:28:07 PM] <Velot> Nuzlocke monkaX
[11/23/18, 8:28:10 PM] <opticalmouse100> I've always wanted to play an rpg where you were basically given a base/village and had to level it up and adventure out from it @Strippin
[11/23/18, 8:28:11 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> @MeccaMaster With a good GM and cast its like a radio show or audio book
[11/23/18, 8:28:11 PM] <lemmy_exe> i hope there is a roleplay game thats based on being in a 90's slasher film
[11/23/18, 8:28:11 PM] <lusobr> I played gen 1 so much that the thought of another gen one playthrough to me is just not interesting
[11/23/18, 8:28:18 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> I think Let's Go focuses a lot more on catching stuff, so you can't really do one catch per route?
[11/23/18, 8:28:25 PM] <Thel_1> Get him LawDaddy!! BabyRage
[11/23/18, 8:28:28 PM] <opticalmouse100> kind of like West Marches
[11/23/18, 8:28:28 PM] <Nefarious_Sloth> a lot of ppl say the new Pokemon game is easy. permafaint is no challenge
[11/23/18, 8:28:42 PM] <Nekros4442> I'd love to see Sam and the crew do a Nuzlocke in the upcoming mainline game. Even better if it takes place in a new region ;p
[11/23/18, 8:28:43 PM] <EvilEden> to player couch coop is fun

[11/23/18, 8:28:50 PM] <KingBendrick> lets go doeesnt have wild battles, the games primary function is to facilitate shiny hunting

[11/23/18, 8:29:02 PM] <wolf_brother7> @Strippin You should be the change you want to see the world. Run a campaign yoursle
[11/23/18, 8:29:03 PM] <CeeGee93> @EvilEden that makes the game ridiculously easy though
[11/23/18, 8:29:04 PM] <MeccaMaster> @PumpkinSpicedCome Yeah I've given quite a few a chance to be honest, and even the ones in which a lot of people I watch on youtube/twitch 24/7 are apart of but not sure, never grabs me
[11/23/18, 8:29:05 PM] <wolf_brother7> *yourself
[11/23/18, 8:29:23 PM] <Nathillon> @Vanillastein Sounds reasonable. Time to get my four players to read all of that, create characters and then start in a year when the reading is done. stripBlank
[11/23/18, 8:29:28 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> the newer pokemon games immediately become 10x more challenging if you turn off exp share and don't overlevel
[11/23/18, 8:29:31 PM] <EvilEden> @CeeGee93 yeah but its also fun, which is the point
[11/23/18, 8:29:31 PM] <lusobr> it isn't
[11/23/18, 8:29:35 PM] <Sluggs_> there are pvp trainer battles
[11/23/18, 8:29:39 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> @Strippin I love watching woops shiny hunt
[11/23/18, 8:29:39 PM] <Erigo> Turns into a chat show more or less
[11/23/18, 8:29:40 PM] <KingBendrick> its that pog factor after 5 hours of standing in the grass
[11/23/18, 8:29:41 PM] <Gorord> They would get viewers not matter what they do
[11/23/18, 8:29:42 PM] <67TrianglesInARow> Shiny hunting is only as fun as the person doing it. You REALLY have to carry the game
[11/23/18, 8:29:42 PM] <Nekros4442> Lets Go is meant to be an accessible game for people that were brought in by Pokemon GO. It definitely isnt meant to be hard or complicated
[11/23/18, 8:29:42 PM] <Darkaros> Somehow people watch Shiny Hunting lol

[11/23/18, 8:29:51 PM] <Andaelas> It'd be fun... with Crendor because that's his type of content
[11/23/18, 8:29:56 PM] <HadieHim> it's a good stream if the streamer interacts with chat, it's just like a 'just chatting' stream
[11/23/18, 8:30:05 PM] <Danivus_> it's just an IRL stream but with game happening in the background really
[11/23/18, 8:30:05 PM] <FEMPUTER_> really hope they don‚Äôt put let‚Äôs go mechanics in any future games
[11/23/18, 8:30:05 PM] <CeeGee93> @EvilEden I mean, if they're doing something like nuzlocke to make the game more challenging and fun, to then make it super easy again would defeat the point, no?
[11/23/18, 8:30:06 PM] <KaseKaizer> FeelsBadMan

[11/23/18, 8:31:04 PM] <Vanillastein> @Nathillon talking about this is making me upset again. woopsS Shadowrun pisses me off because it's such a great setting with a lot of good content, but it's buried behind 500 writers that don't talk to each other and a literal mountain of fluff that has no place in a rulebook. woopsS

[11/23/18, 8:44:41 PM] <hypasonic> You can't evolve the eevee you get at the start of the game

[11/23/18, 8:44:46 PM] <HadieHim> you can catch a DIFFERENT one and evolve that one
[11/23/18, 8:44:47 PM] <Ventas13_> your starter can't evolve

[11/23/18, 8:44:49 PM] <Yharnamite> You can still catch an eevee though and evolve that one though LUL

[11/23/18, 8:44:50 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> @Strippin You could have a party of Jolteons with an impossibly powerful Eevee leading the charge

[11/23/18, 8:44:57 PM] <Ionis22> ohh shit i go loo and comback and suddenly a wild benji
[11/23/18, 8:44:58 PM] <ArgentEsper> Sure, you can't evolve the starter buddy eevee, but you can catch another one and evolve it, so who cares?
[11/23/18, 8:44:58 PM] <CaptainSteyr> You can't evolve your starting Eevee/Pikachu. You can if you find more in the world.
[11/23/18, 8:44:59 PM] <KingBendrick> it has the same genetic defect as people that buy lets go
[11/23/18, 8:44:59 PM] <TrueFenix> calling ash's pikachu defective FeelsBadMan
[11/23/18, 8:45:01 PM] <revree> @Strippin its better to go pikachu if you want jolteon so you can get an eevee you can actually evolve
[11/23/18, 8:45:01 PM] <Munetani_> You mean Eevee, the pokemon MADE TO EVOLVE does not evolve?
[11/23/18, 8:45:01 PM] <Darkaros> You can't evolve your starter because then you can't dress them up stripBaka It's nice
[11/23/18, 8:45:02 PM] <Ophirin> It's like the Pikachu from Yellow
[11/23/18, 8:45:03 PM] <Poptonic> A defective evee LUL
[11/23/18, 8:45:04 PM] <MilkNPC> Dont need to evolve when youu can smack em with that Baddy Bad
[11/23/18, 8:45:06 PM] <threesnail59048> why do you like heavy?
[11/23/18, 8:45:06 PM] <TDesius> @Strippin YOU CANT evolve the ORIGINAL Eevee or Pikachu you start with (It doesnt like the stones, just like Pikachu from the show), you can catch others and use it
[11/23/18, 8:45:11 PM] <Vanillastein> @Strippin The starter pikachu can learn surf though.
[11/23/18, 8:45:12 PM] <simpliv> You have to pretend it's the anime and have a unevolved Pikachu forever
[11/23/18, 8:45:17 PM] <zari1600> get that evee and shove him in the pc
[11/23/18, 8:45:18 PM] <Darkaros> (or they're too lazy to implement multiple models with outfits)
[11/23/18, 8:45:18 PM] <zari1600> yeah

[11/23/18, 8:46:33 PM] <KaseKaizer> I mean... you could evolve the pikachu in pokemon Yellow
[11/23/18, 8:46:34 PM] <M4DHatterr> level 100 eevee would run through the elite 4 just saying

[11/23/18, 8:46:57 PM] <spencer7665> Why not just let it evolve at that point?
[11/23/18, 8:46:57 PM] <Vanillastein> @Strippin It gets special moves to offset its woopsADD evolutionary deficiency.

[11/23/18, 8:47:03 PM] <ArgentEsper> Again, the starters not evolving doesn't matter. You can get both pikachu and eevee in the wild.
[11/23/18, 8:47:04 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> I heard from some friends who're all playing the Eevee version that it just wipes the floor with everything
[11/23/18, 8:47:05 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> @Strippin you can get normal eevees in game so

[11/23/18, 8:49:18 PM] <ArgentEsper> @Mbjosh3573 That's wrong. Random wild battles for trash has been replaced with Go's catching mini game. Special and Legendaries still have wild battles, and beyond that it's just a Yellow remake.

[11/23/18, 8:56:50 PM] <KingBendrick> its divergent evolution, it kinda makes sense, mega evolutions is some SS shit
[11/23/18, 8:56:52 PM] <Ophirin> @LordXaras Before they made Alolan Persian
[11/23/18, 8:56:57 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> and for some reason all the ultra beasts look like some of the human characters, too? stripBlank
[11/23/18, 8:56:57 PM] <Sluggs_> whats your opinion on adding fairy types to the game and changing a lot of old pokemon to fairy
[11/23/18, 8:56:57 PM] <Darkaros> I like the new gen's gimmicks, but I love Alolan variations the most by far.
[11/23/18, 8:56:58 PM] <CheekyTM> Could you imagine some Jellyfish chillin around MArs
[11/23/18, 8:56:59 PM] <TheArgentGod> deoxys is from space, not an alternate dimension
[11/23/18, 8:56:59 PM] <Vanillastein> Ultrabeasts are from the ULTRA dimension. COGGERS
[11/23/18, 8:57:00 PM] <gibbonobo> but its differnet dimensions not space
[11/23/18, 8:57:02 PM] <kalculate> Ultra-beast sounds really dumb.
[11/23/18, 8:57:03 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> How has there not been a ghost fox Pokemon???
[11/23/18, 8:57:04 PM] <RimeSkeem> Ultra Beasts aren't from space they're from another dimension
[11/23/18, 8:57:06 PM] <67TrianglesInARow> Is clefairy an ultra beast? NotLikeThis
[11/23/18, 8:57:07 PM] <Velot> What happened to the days when Pokemon were just Pokemon PepeHands

[11/23/18, 8:57:53 PM] <no1papa> @Strippin what do you think about the fact that pokemon went from being really cool concepts to being cartoonized versions of things like lamps and chandeliers...?
[11/23/18, 8:57:54 PM] <Vanillastein> @Velot Yeah, if you can survive the lag in Sun/Moon you can go to another dimension and catch literally everything. Pog
[11/23/18, 8:57:56 PM] <TheArgentGod> there's also TIMELINES
[11/23/18, 8:58:00 PM] <Ophirin> @Strippin Palkia/Dialga/Giratina/Arceus are widely excepted across all games now
[11/23/18, 8:58:00 PM] <endwell> @robinwaterweasel it is 40 no
[11/23/18, 8:58:01 PM] <robinwaterweasel> yes an mmo pokemon game would be lit

[11/23/18, 8:58:19 PM] <robinwaterweasel> thanks
[11/23/18, 8:58:20 PM] <gibbonobo> honestly it would be exciting if one of the games was like mon hun world where the first settlers from the alolan region try to explore the ultra dimension
[11/23/18, 8:58:21 PM] <Ophirin> @Strippin where as Groudon is just a legendary in one region

[11/23/18, 8:58:33 PM] <OverbeingXVI> ho-oh
[11/23/18, 8:58:34 PM] <Velot> Pokemon should just be dogs that can shoot fire, not gods.
[11/23/18, 8:58:35 PM] <k2i3n4g5> some of legendaries got pretty silly
[11/23/18, 8:58:37 PM] <HadieHim> there are multiple of those legendary birds
[11/23/18, 8:58:40 PM] <Uvahash> @acepps So they have space Rabies
[11/23/18, 8:58:47 PM] <ivaaan> but lugia and ho-oh were the moon and sun birds
[11/23/18, 8:58:49 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Yeah if they kept it "animal like" it'd be better
[11/23/18, 8:58:53 PM] <RimeSkeem> I do love Solgaleo though

[11/23/18, 8:59:08 PM] <Darkaros> I mean we captured God in like gen5 (?) so there was nowhere to go from there
[11/23/18, 8:59:11 PM] <k2i3n4g5> I think they really started to have a problem when they said "this is the first pokemon ever" like 5 times lol
[11/23/18, 8:59:12 PM] <lambsaucysauce> So that's how they counter the Turtle meta. Unblockables everywhere

[11/23/18, 8:59:32 PM] <Ophirin> I liked the legendary pokemon in Sun/Moon then they started adding more

[11/23/18, 8:59:40 PM] <rumblymarrow> I was that ten year old catching god so that's my shit man

[11/23/18, 9:11:11 PM] <Springfart> the mystery dungeon games were great
[11/23/18, 9:11:14 PM] <Sir_Pinkly> @robinwaterweasel YES
[11/23/18, 9:11:19 PM] <Ashyran1> well atleast its made shiny hunting easy
[11/23/18, 9:11:19 PM] <ArgentEsper> @Radical_Dreamer I hope they keep the partner pokemon too.
[11/23/18, 9:11:21 PM] <BaBamalama> ok, vikings theme song, thats hot
[11/23/18, 9:11:25 PM] <HadieHim> the next gen will be normal
[11/23/18, 9:11:25 PM] <ThatFezGuy> Also im so glad that my favourite pokemon has a top tier shiny

[11/23/18, 9:11:26 PM] <HadieHim> jesus
[11/23/18, 9:11:27 PM] <spikebomb5> why not just make it ranger/myster dungeon LUL
[11/23/18, 9:11:28 PM] <Justalittleruckus> @dmansouls Statistics be darned! XD
[11/23/18, 9:11:29 PM] <Springfart> kids these days
[11/23/18, 9:11:29 PM] <Nobleprinceps> True LUL
[11/23/18, 9:11:31 PM] <Ashyran1> when it was hard
[11/23/18, 9:11:32 PM] <Pnutz_> this is for the mobile phone gamers
[11/23/18, 9:11:32 PM] <Ophirin> We soften up the kiddies
[11/23/18, 9:11:32 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> It is just a side game what is the harm
[11/23/18, 9:11:33 PM] <OneSpicyBoii> Yeah, but kids nowadays want things to be easier
[11/23/18, 9:11:34 PM] <robinwaterweasel> literally bought a ds and 3ds for pokemon
[11/23/18, 9:11:35 PM] <TheArgentGod> it's not for kids, it's for super casual non-players
[11/23/18, 9:11:36 PM] <Pnutz_> the extra casuals
[11/23/18, 9:11:39 PM] <OneSpicyBoii> Not memeing, its truth
[11/23/18, 9:11:39 PM] <Ashyran1> like the zubat caves
[11/23/18, 9:11:39 PM] <osakey> It's a side game that isn't replacing the usual generation games.
[11/23/18, 9:11:40 PM] <zari1600> Kids have gotten a lot more casual in their gaming preferences - Nintendo
[11/23/18, 9:11:43 PM] <MrCrosby> i know this is his playlist but does anyone know where i could get this music
[11/23/18, 9:11:45 PM] <Ophirin> makes them easier to confuse and control
[11/23/18, 9:11:46 PM] <Springfart> i literally had to teach myself english to progress through red/blue back in the day
[11/23/18, 9:11:47 PM] <Rocyourface> Kid's focus is different now then it was then though. Shorten attention means you need a simpler game with faster reward
[11/23/18, 9:11:47 PM] <Vanillastein> One day they'll make it so pokemon has a difficulty option. PepeHands
[11/23/18, 9:11:51 PM] <Ophirin> SOFTEN THEM BRAINS
[11/23/18, 9:11:51 PM] <Springfart> cause i was like 5-6 when they came out
[11/23/18, 9:11:53 PM] <ArgentEsper> Ultimately it's just the "muh nostalgia" argument. /shrug
[11/23/18, 9:11:55 PM] <volatilevagabond> Viking theme POG
[11/23/18, 9:11:56 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Developers underestimate childrens abilities nowadays
[11/23/18, 9:11:57 PM] <KingBendrick> lets go really makes you feel like dorris, 84 from sommerset
[11/23/18, 9:11:59 PM] <spikebomb5> @ZeroDarkBlaze yes its true, but taking sun+moon into account, there is a trend of casualization
[11/23/18, 9:12:00 PM] <k2i3n4g5> @Vanillastein I feel dat
[11/23/18, 9:12:04 PM] <Ophirin> Soften then control their brains
[11/23/18, 9:12:07 PM] <kalculate> I actually think it's fine. It makes more sense that you're not having your pets beat the shit out of wild pets so you can catch them.
[11/23/18, 9:12:12 PM] <Chase_Yojimbo> @OneSpicyBoii No, the parents want them to be easier for the kids. We also have generations of developers who are parents now. New perspectives in development.
[11/23/18, 9:12:13 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> Sun and moon were fun
[11/23/18, 9:12:13 PM] <robinwaterweasel> alot also caters to the japanese market, not just US market
[11/23/18, 9:12:16 PM] <Pacohax> @vanillastein I mean I think there was a difficulty option in on gen?
[11/23/18, 9:12:16 PM] <Nefarious_Sloth> to me it just feels like half a game now.
[11/23/18, 9:12:16 PM] <67TrianglesInARow> @Strippin Exactly. These days, games are just getting easier and easier and there are a lot of values that were enforced in children through video games in the past that are no longer because they're trying to pander towards participation trophy mentality
[11/23/18, 9:12:18 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> That's not my argument. I always hated wild battles. I guess I play the cute pet game differently. For everyone else its the cock fighting game LUL
[11/23/18, 9:12:20 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Sun and moon is super casual
[11/23/18, 9:12:24 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> @Vanillastein they did in Black (I think?) but for some reason it was postgame and then they took it out stripSip
[11/23/18, 9:12:26 PM] <Pacohax> One gen even

[11/23/18, 9:12:29 PM] <osakey> That's like saying that the Pokemon Stadium games are dumbing down pokemon and changing the base mechanics LUL
[11/23/18, 9:12:33 PM] <Springfart> @Strippin excited for the new season of vikings next week?
[11/23/18, 9:12:35 PM] <BadBadTerrible> B I G E B O Y
[11/23/18, 9:12:35 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> I think people get too "hardcore" about pokemon
[11/23/18, 9:12:36 PM] <Nprp9wf9 > is this the op9 from Vikings :D?
[11/23/18, 9:12:38 PM] <Velot> @ArgentEsper Disagreement is nostalgia.
[11/23/18, 9:12:52 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> @ZeroDarkBlaze The truest thing ever said right there
[11/23/18, 9:12:54 PM] <ArgentEsper> @Velot I didn't say that, but you probably didn't read the first thing I said either. LUL
[11/23/18, 9:12:59 PM] <rumblymarrow> I mean they really do get too hardcore about pokemon
[11/23/18, 9:13:01 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> "casualized" as if it was ever a hard game

[11/23/18, 9:13:14 PM] <theycallmemistateeps> Is this your personal playlist or did they change the music and I didn‚Äôt notice @Strippin?
[11/23/18, 9:13:19 PM] <robinwaterweasel> @Strippin IMMIGRANT SONG
[11/23/18, 9:13:24 PM] <Johnny_Richer> Nice so
[11/23/18, 9:13:24 PM] <arkoin> ur going to be disappointed
[11/23/18, 9:13:24 PM] <67TrianglesInARow> Just because something wasn't difficult doesn't mean it can't get even easier
[11/23/18, 9:13:27 PM] <acepps> it's not casualized it stripped down and i don't like stripped down
[11/23/18, 9:13:28 PM] <BaBamalama> new season isnt like the others, dont be expecting great things. Its still good tho
[11/23/18, 9:13:33 PM] <Losingmastered> RareParrot
[11/23/18, 9:13:35 PM] <Vanillastein> @Pacohax Each game had a different difficulty option, if you wanted both you had to link the games. FeelsWeirdMan And it wasn't much of a difficulty increase. I'm talking a difficulty where AI have actual teams, not every sprite has the same theme for the entire game, they can switch out and use items regularly, that kind of thing.
[11/23/18, 9:13:37 PM] <DManSouls> I wish shiny gengar was mega gengars coloring FeelsBadMan
[11/23/18, 9:13:37 PM] <k2i3n4g5> I feel like if they have basically two series, Let's Go and the main line then that could work
[11/23/18, 9:13:38 PM] <minedixer> pepeJAM
[11/23/18, 9:13:38 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> I don't really care about it being "hardcore" , I just want it to go smooth and quick without hundreds of forced happy-go-lucky cutscenes
[11/23/18, 9:13:38 PM] <DrSpookenstein> @theycallmemistateeps It's from youtube
[11/23/18, 9:13:39 PM] <Sir_Pinkly> I need to catch up Vikings too. I left off with Ragnar challenging his sons.
[11/23/18, 9:13:46 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> I am talking about the main single player @Ophirin
[11/23/18, 9:13:49 PM] <Lord_Epsilon> @ZeroDarkBlaze I mean, they literally removed the gameplay, it's not about being "casual" or "Hardcore" IMHO
[11/23/18, 9:13:52 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> pepeD
[11/23/18, 9:13:57 PM] <Springfart> pepeD
[11/23/18, 9:13:59 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> @Strippin The thing with making games easier is because now everyone, especially kids, has such a short, retarded attention span that anything difficult will cause a huge drop in players immediately no matter what
[11/23/18, 9:13:59 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Making the game painful to play
[11/23/18, 9:14:00 PM] <Ophirin> @ZeroDarkBlaze I get ya
[11/23/18, 9:14:02 PM] <Inkanobi> @Sir_Pinkly I'm going to be perfectly honest. It all gets worse as the show goes on
[11/23/18, 9:14:05 PM] <Vanillastein> @Radical_Dreamer Yeah, and they managed to fuck that up, one of the reasons I dislike Nintendo as a company. woopsBaka
[11/23/18, 9:14:09 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> @Lord_Epsilon They didn't cause its not a main game

[11/23/18, 9:14:50 PM] <Sir_Pinkly> @Inkanobi Well Floki was falling from grace anyway and Rangar was getting weird so I ain't to fussed.
[11/23/18, 9:14:53 PM] <DManSouls> the difficulty option on pokemon is easy, just dont use the op af starter it gives you and turn auto swap out off in battles
[11/23/18, 9:14:54 PM] <volatilevagabond> Nah viking is fine
[11/23/18, 9:15:00 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> I am just saying as an RPG it never been hard
[11/23/18, 9:15:04 PM] <Ophirin> @ZeroDarkBlaze But that's also artificial difficulty increase
[11/23/18, 9:15:05 PM] <Inkanobi> Pinkly, it gets worse

[11/23/18, 9:15:29 PM] <Inkanobi> All manners of writing
[11/23/18, 9:15:34 PM] <Vanillastein> If they would just make the AI have functional teams, and each trainer have a pool of items they could use, it'd be so much better. PepeHands
[11/23/18, 9:15:36 PM] <Darkaros> Or just do actual post-game Pokemon content
[11/23/18, 9:15:39 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> FF2 is painful
[11/23/18, 9:15:41 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> Like I get why the complains but I think if you judge go as a mainline game its just silly
[11/23/18, 9:15:45 PM] <Darkaros> I spent so many hours on Emerald's Battle Towers etc
[11/23/18, 9:15:47 PM] <Ophirin> @LiskWithoutBasil Yeah....

[11/23/18, 9:18:20 PM] <simpliv> Doesn't cutting out the filler episodes from Naruto drop it to like 800 episodes?

[11/23/18, 9:18:46 PM] <Plan_A_Has_Failed> Yeah I feel like they could've spent an entire season focusing just on Ivar and another on Bjorn
[11/23/18, 9:18:47 PM] <Shockr4> @Strippin look at it this way if you watched an episode of one piece every day youd be caught up to current episodes in 3 years

[11/23/18, 9:19:40 PM] <k2i3n4g5> Shonen anime are basically not worth unless you start watching from the start
[11/23/18, 9:19:43 PM] <Ophirin> @Nefarious_Sloth They catching up on the manga

[11/23/18, 9:19:53 PM] <robinwaterweasel> why watch the generic shonen when th best shonen FMA:Brotherhood exists, just watch that
[11/23/18, 9:19:55 PM] <Munetani_> Not One Piece
[11/23/18, 9:19:58 PM] <Springfart> @Strippin just use a guide to skip the filler arcs
[11/23/18, 9:20:08 PM] <Stickiler> @Strippin If you're worried about all the shitty anime tropes, I can wholeheartedly recommend PsychoPass, it's only 2 seasons, but even TB enjoyed it.
[11/23/18, 9:20:08 PM] <Ophirin> you could watch ONE PACE that cuts out the bad filler
[11/23/18, 9:20:09 PM] <Springfart> one piece doesn't have any fillers compared to naruto
[11/23/18, 9:20:10 PM] <DManSouls> there is no filler in one piece its all gold FeelsGoodMan

[11/23/18, 9:20:11 PM] <TheDepresso> One Piece is garbage for the first like 200 episodes
[11/23/18, 9:20:12 PM] <Munetani_> But to be fair it's better to READOne Piece, much faster
[11/23/18, 9:20:15 PM] <TheDepresso> I couldn't stomach it
[11/23/18, 9:20:15 PM] <SirBeefie> Naruto is a really good 70 episode series... told over 500 episodes
[11/23/18, 9:20:17 PM] <ivaaan> one piece is one of the long runners that have the least ammount of filler, like 30 ¬®if im not mistaken
[11/23/18, 9:20:17 PM] <robinwaterweasel> doogs would help sam for naruto, shes watched it all through, so has octo
[11/23/18, 9:20:17 PM] <Springfart> naruto is literally like 60% fillers
[11/23/18, 9:20:20 PM] <KingBendrick> here's a guide: dont watch it, it trash
[11/23/18, 9:20:20 PM] <Danivus_> please, one piece takes 12 episodes to do what could be done in 1
[11/23/18, 9:20:21 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Naruto has flashbacks for half the episode at some points
[11/23/18, 9:20:23 PM] <somerandomlurk> personally think most shonen is trash
[11/23/18, 9:20:23 PM] <Phoeb0s> problem with one piece is it doesnt have filler arcs teh anime just has really slow pacing which can be hard to get through
[11/23/18, 9:20:23 PM] <trystis> Both of those shows are so overrated
[11/23/18, 9:20:24 PM] <ThatFezGuy> dragon ball is still my go too shonen anime
[11/23/18, 9:20:25 PM] <volatilevagabond> Agreed fuck fillers
[11/23/18, 9:20:27 PM] <Kashyr> frankly the one peice anime is lazy as hell anyway. wasted potential of the source material.
[11/23/18, 9:20:29 PM] <Shockr4> i said that statement more sarcastically lol iv seen every episode of one piece and still watch it every week
[11/23/18, 9:20:30 PM] <Nefarious_Sloth> and bleach
[11/23/18, 9:20:35 PM] <Justalittleruckus> 1/2 of each episode is a recap in one piece
[11/23/18, 9:20:37 PM] <Narithra> nothing heavy apart from his weight :D
[11/23/18, 9:20:37 PM] <Ophirin> One piece bout to be ALL filler

[11/23/18, 9:20:41 PM] <Munetani_> Better read One Piece honestly
[11/23/18, 9:20:47 PM] <spikebomb5> @TheDepresso your wrong tho, more like the anime is not worth watching at all after the timeskip

[11/23/18, 9:21:29 PM] <Nefarious_Sloth> another good but short anime is code geass
[11/23/18, 9:21:31 PM] <BWood63> At this point the filler is the best part of one piece since it‚Äôs paced decently
[11/23/18, 9:21:35 PM] <Ophirin> @Springfart But an episode covers several chapters and they do like an episode a week for how many weeks eventually they will catch up
[11/23/18, 9:21:41 PM] <Vanillastein> @Nefarious_Sloth Just as planned, but anime*

[11/23/18, 9:24:08 PM] <Xuhybrid> He's not a pedo though, he likes fighting powerful people
[11/23/18, 9:24:09 PM] <joytries> just because he's a villain doesn't make it okay lmfao

[11/23/18, 9:24:28 PM] <Springfart> doesn't mean the entire show is bad just because one character is a creep
[11/23/18, 9:24:29 PM] <codeGnave> black clover is CLEARLY the best shonen
[11/23/18, 9:24:30 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> A pedophile homicidal clown and he's not the worst character in the show
[11/23/18, 9:24:36 PM] <Xuhybrid> He is pretty weird tho
[11/23/18, 9:24:40 PM] <robinwaterweasel> black lagoon is good

[11/23/18, 9:24:54 PM] <Darkaros> I mean said creepy clown is a bad guy so it's not like the anime's condoning it waffleD
[11/23/18, 9:24:55 PM] <ryannsca> that was the closeup
[11/23/18, 9:25:02 PM] <Kashyr> @Strippin you should give it another chance or just watch story highlights. still one of the best power systems and world storys in shonnen
[11/23/18, 9:25:04 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> It has creative powers
[11/23/18, 9:25:04 PM] <Velot> Can't be as bad as Prison School though @Strippin
[11/23/18, 9:25:05 PM] <bromanatee> oic
[11/23/18, 9:25:08 PM] <Phoeb0s> also you say the title as just "hunter hunter" no x

[11/23/18, 9:25:13 PM] <somerandomlurk> alot of anime has weird pedo vibes
[11/23/18, 9:25:14 PM] <Nefarious_Sloth> attack on titan is so good
[11/23/18, 9:25:15 PM] <Nekros4442> HxH is basically just JoJos but worse
[11/23/18, 9:25:15 PM] <ryannsca> hisokas power for me was probably the coolest
[11/23/18, 9:25:15 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> You know its bad when the pedo murder clown cares about the kid more than the kid's father

[11/23/18, 9:27:21 PM] <TheDepresso> @Strippin the first season of jojos is hot garbage don't watch it
[11/23/18, 9:27:25 PM] <Farfalus> wreeeeeeee

[11/23/18, 9:28:03 PM] <spikebomb5> opm isnt shonen
[11/23/18, 9:28:03 PM] <Erigo> Part 1 is like from the Fist of the North Star era so it's pretty dated in those practices
[11/23/18, 9:28:04 PM] <Afeks> MHA would be better without deku as the mc
[11/23/18, 9:28:06 PM] <ivaaan> one punch man is not a good shounen, its a parody of all shounen
[11/23/18, 9:28:07 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> one punch man is the loony tunes of shonen
[11/23/18, 9:28:08 PM] <Holrend> my hero is character drama
[11/23/18, 9:28:12 PM] <ArgentEsper> One Punch Man was pretty funny. One of the best parodies, I've ever seen.
[11/23/18, 9:28:14 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> It has bad writing but is so creative and memeable
[11/23/18, 9:28:14 PM] <Darkaros> Honestly so far Sam's opinions are just extreme versions of why I don't watch anime x/y/z itmejp10
[11/23/18, 9:28:17 PM] <Munetani_> @Strippin Did you see MobPsycho 100 from the same author as OPM?
[11/23/18, 9:28:20 PM] <Pnutz_> Have you watched Mob Psycho 100?
[11/23/18, 9:28:20 PM] <ShuttleTV> @Strippin watch world trigger its a tactical shounen
[11/23/18, 9:28:21 PM] <Xuhybrid> Jojo is a parody of shonen tropes
[11/23/18, 9:28:21 PM] <Shockr4> @Strippin i know dodger likes it but have you ever watched Kuroko no basuke?
[11/23/18, 9:28:22 PM] <Kashyr> its a paradoy
[11/23/18, 9:28:22 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> It is
[11/23/18, 9:28:24 PM] <rumblymarrow> it's a parady of shonen
[11/23/18, 9:28:27 PM] <Munetani_> It's comedy
[11/23/18, 9:28:27 PM] <Pnutz_> Same creator as one punch
[11/23/18, 9:28:31 PM] <kazen01> it makes fun of shonen but its still shonen
[11/23/18, 9:28:32 PM] <KaseKaizer> the thing about Jojo is that everything that isn't Jojo.... is actually Jojo
[11/23/18, 9:28:34 PM] <Erigo> LUL IT'S TOTALLY SHOUNEN LUL
[11/23/18, 9:28:35 PM] <SteelStitch> one punch man is a straight up comedy
[11/23/18, 9:28:38 PM] <TheBebopCrew> that's still shounen
[11/23/18, 9:28:40 PM] <bromanatee> it's classified as seinen but it's in shonen jump
[11/23/18, 9:28:40 PM] <robinwaterweasel> its shonen
[11/23/18, 9:28:41 PM] <Plan_A_Has_Failed> I find comedic parodies of shonen are usually better than actual shonen
[11/23/18, 9:28:43 PM] <KingBendrick> OPM is a subversion of the shounen tropes via satire but it fills out the criteria of a shounen
[11/23/18, 9:28:44 PM] <Darkaros> Gurren Lagaan is a parody of Mecha Animes and is still a Mecha Anime stripBaka

[11/23/18, 9:28:46 PM] <Xuhybrid> I agree, i didn't like Jojo at all really
[11/23/18, 9:28:46 PM] <Nekros4442> I would say try season 2 Sam. Jojo seasons are mostly isolated so you can watch Season 2 where it starts kicking off. S1 was where he was still trying to imitate Hokuto no Ken alot
[11/23/18, 9:28:47 PM] <Lord_Epsilon> You did this @KingBendrick
[11/23/18, 9:28:49 PM] <TheDepresso> Parry?
[11/23/18, 9:28:49 PM] <Lawlman> Chat FailFish
[11/23/18, 9:28:50 PM] <rare_yogurt> It's a shounen that's satire on shounen
[11/23/18, 9:28:50 PM] <replicase> @woolba_ thanks for the rec
[11/23/18, 9:28:52 PM] <xGilford> MOB Psycho is getting a second season this Autumn Pog
[11/23/18, 9:28:52 PM] <Pnutz_> Its a comedy shonen LUL
[11/23/18, 9:28:53 PM] <Stickiler> I mean, 1 punch man was a shounen parody while being an amazing shounen
[11/23/18, 9:28:54 PM] <VorpalPotato> Its a deconstruction of Shonen, its still Shonen.
[11/23/18, 9:28:55 PM] <Neondangel> Calling something a parody DOESN'T make it automatically better
[11/23/18, 9:28:55 PM] <kalculate> Amish Paradise is a great song on its' own.
[11/23/18, 9:28:55 PM] <Faintlich> Parry a shonen PogChamp
[11/23/18, 9:28:56 PM] <Erigo> Duh that means Weird Al isn't music rooDerp
[11/23/18, 9:28:56 PM] <DManSouls> the actual manga is a seinen its fing B R U T A L
[11/23/18, 9:28:56 PM] <Ventas13_> it's defo shounen
[11/23/18, 9:28:57 PM] <Justalittleruckus> A vampire spoof is still a movie about vampires
[11/23/18, 9:29:01 PM] <Reinest> parody, like excel saga
[11/23/18, 9:29:01 PM] <bromanatee> shonen is an age demographic, it can be argued that it's too graphic for shonen
[11/23/18, 9:29:01 PM] <ArgentEsper> lol
[11/23/18, 9:29:03 PM] <spikebomb5> "comedy shonen" there is no growth of the mc LUL
[11/23/18, 9:29:04 PM] <BirdReligion> it's a parody of shounen... still a shounen... have you guys read the manga... it's just a normal shounen
[11/23/18, 9:29:04 PM] <BWood63> If OPM is the only shonen you list then you don't like shonen
[11/23/18, 9:29:06 PM] <Lord_Epsilon> All that's happening right now, it's your fault @KingBendrick Kappa
[11/23/18, 9:29:06 PM] <zari1600> It's a documentary on shonen
[11/23/18, 9:29:08 PM] <gibbonobo> @Strippin just curious what do you know about jojo beyond what you watched?
[11/23/18, 9:29:09 PM] <Stranglethroat> Blue World Order was still wrestling
[11/23/18, 9:29:18 PM] <StreamElements> stripT stripT stripT fr0st_night just resubbed for 3 months in a row stripT stripT stripT
[11/23/18, 9:29:18 PM] <gibbonobo> the opinion seems to be you got unlucky with the episode
[11/23/18, 9:29:22 PM] <ArgentEsper> OPM is a documentary... LUL
[11/23/18, 9:29:27 PM] <Erigo> @bromanatee It was marketed towards that age group at the time it was made
[11/23/18, 9:29:27 PM] <Moobot> Like what ya see? Subscribe and join the Stripp Club to receive cool custom emotes and more! http://tinyurl.com/nrhosym
[11/23/18, 9:29:27 PM] <Lcnt> One Punch Man is for a slightly older audience, hence not shonen
[11/23/18, 9:29:30 PM] <Holrend> @Strippin did you watched Castlevania?
[11/23/18, 9:29:32 PM] <Spriggals> !song
[11/23/18, 9:29:39 PM] <simpliv> oof
[11/23/18, 9:29:43 PM] <Vanillastein> A jojos slumber party? FeelsWeirdMan
[11/23/18, 9:29:45 PM] <ivaaan> what else besides mha and one punch
[11/23/18, 9:29:46 PM] <HadieHim> im sorry you had to go through that
[11/23/18, 9:29:46 PM] <KaseKaizer> I... wut
[11/23/18, 9:29:48 PM] <thunderhatter> do you read manga strippin?
[11/23/18, 9:29:53 PM] <Xuhybrid> Third season is my least favourite, the one with Stands O.o
[11/23/18, 9:29:54 PM] <Nekros4442> oh yeah, Golden Wind gets crazy
[11/23/18, 9:29:57 PM] <spikebomb5> maybe just read manga then LUL
[11/23/18, 9:29:58 PM] <bromanatee> the gore makes it seinen but it follows and parodies lots of shonen battle manga conventions
[11/23/18, 9:29:59 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Shounen is series for teenage boys, and OPM isn't seinen
[11/23/18, 9:30:00 PM] <Gogogolem> but you like one punch man that does the same thing
[11/23/18, 9:30:01 PM] <BirdReligion> watch the very first season. its way less stupid.
[11/23/18, 9:30:05 PM] <simpliv> JJBA fans are really overbearing about liking JJBA
[11/23/18, 9:30:09 PM] <Xuhybrid> You finally get through 12 guys to where we're going, 12 more filler LUL
[11/23/18, 9:30:09 PM] <KaseKaizer> part 5?
[11/23/18, 9:30:14 PM] <PatbTV> Sam, What controller are you going to use for Smash?
[11/23/18, 9:30:17 PM] <BWood63> The ridiculous explanations are the best part
[11/23/18, 9:30:19 PM] <Vanillastein> @Strippin The combat in Jojos is about finding the dumbest little weakness in a power though.
[11/23/18, 9:30:20 PM] <Toons11> don't clarify, leave minds fucked continue.
[11/23/18, 9:30:22 PM] <zari1600> The first season was best season for JoJo the rest are just meh
[11/23/18, 9:30:23 PM] <BirdReligion> @simpliv as bad as One Piece fans...?
[11/23/18, 9:30:24 PM] <Phoeb0s> if its not for you its not for you lol. I love JoJo for sure but its not for everyone
[11/23/18, 9:30:25 PM] <KingBendrick> OPM is a traditional japanese stone garden assembly show that airs from 4-5pm daytime in North america, therefore it is considered by many to be shounen
[11/23/18, 9:30:27 PM] <Erigo> Once you get through all the explanations of the rules and stuff it allows for crazy cool stuff to happen imo
[11/23/18, 9:30:29 PM] <DrivenAnarchy> i dont watch anime :)
[11/23/18, 9:30:32 PM] <Ariamis13> To be fair there is a fuck ton of dialogue in jojo. Does actually get on my nerves
[11/23/18, 9:30:33 PM] <DManSouls> i like jojos because its funny FeelsGoodMan
[11/23/18, 9:30:39 PM] <HadieHim> and then there's My Hero that explains everything it needs to in about 1 or 2 seconds, quick n easy
[11/23/18, 9:30:40 PM] <trystis> Basic writing. Show, don‚Äôt tell.
[11/23/18, 9:30:44 PM] <robinwaterweasel> @Strippin what would you say is your fave anime/manga?
[11/23/18, 9:30:45 PM] <ArgentEsper> @DrivenAnarchy You're probably the better for it. lol
[11/23/18, 9:30:50 PM] <Bianca_X23> JoJo's part 3 is by fair my favourite still
[11/23/18, 9:30:50 PM] <ivaaan> i get i just dont like it LUL
[11/23/18, 9:30:51 PM] <Holrend> do you like Fate?
[11/23/18, 9:30:53 PM] <dankiusdank> T-pose
[11/23/18, 9:30:57 PM] <Ventas13_> Jojo is like Sam explaining Jojo LUL
[11/23/18, 9:31:02 PM] <Vanillastein> @Strippin Honestly, the only thing you really need to know about Jojos is that Speedwagon is best waifu.
[11/23/18, 9:31:02 PM] <Lawlman> bobobobobobobo
[11/23/18, 9:31:07 PM] <Ariamis13> My hero sometimes falls into that trap of over explaining obvious things
[11/23/18, 9:31:07 PM] <acepps> why can't people just like different things why's it always a damn anime war
[11/23/18, 9:31:08 PM] <Vanillastein> @Lawlman woopsS no
[11/23/18, 9:31:10 PM] <robinwaterweasel> @Lawlman YES
[11/23/18, 9:31:15 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> part 3 is pretty shit
[11/23/18, 9:31:24 PM] <Afeks> fate stay night and zero are the only good ones
[11/23/18, 9:31:25 PM] <Darkaros> bobobo had fusions, I think child-me blocked some of them out stripNam
[11/23/18, 9:31:25 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> But funny
[11/23/18, 9:31:26 PM] <spikebomb5> i mean, most ppl are listing animes that are adapted from manga DansGame
[11/23/18, 9:31:26 PM] <rumblymarrow> Waifu wars the anime
[11/23/18, 9:31:30 PM] <BWood63> I don't think Sam likes anime guys
[11/23/18, 9:31:32 PM] <ivaaan> what else besides MHA and one punch shounen do you like ? @Strippin
[11/23/18, 9:31:33 PM] <Darkaros> Because current-me is traumatized by some of them
[11/23/18, 9:31:33 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> Fate/zero everything else can be ignored
[11/23/18, 9:31:35 PM] <dankiusdank> LB buff pls
[11/23/18, 9:31:42 PM] <BirdReligion> fate has gonna crazier and crazier. Zero and Stay Night at least make sense
[11/23/18, 9:31:42 PM] <HolyDance> Fate/Zero is the only good one
[11/23/18, 9:31:45 PM] <Argumus> every Saber looks the same
[11/23/18, 9:31:45 PM] <replicase> that's the only way to enjoy Evangelion as well
[11/23/18, 9:31:47 PM] <Riflebird> Fate/Zero is fantastic.
[11/23/18, 9:31:48 PM] <buzzkillington_> Watch Fate/Zero and pretend the rest doesn't exist .
[11/23/18, 9:31:48 PM] <DManSouls> @Strippin just play the visual novel
[11/23/18, 9:31:48 PM] <bromanatee> what kind of anime does sam like?
[11/23/18, 9:31:48 PM] <SmileyBoloney> Fate story line is Pokemon with historical characters
[11/23/18, 9:31:54 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> That new slime show is weirdly really good
[11/23/18, 9:31:55 PM] <replicase> the lore is nonsensical, just enjoy the weirdness and mechas
[11/23/18, 9:31:55 PM] <rare_yogurt> Yo I donated but idk if it went through properly lol, it told me thanks but i never got a paypal notif
[11/23/18, 9:31:56 PM] <Faintlich> Sounds just like Pokemon, nobody understands that insane lore
[11/23/18, 9:31:56 PM] <Vanillastein> I've heard of so many "Fate/____" That I have no interest in trying to figure out which one to watch.
[11/23/18, 9:31:58 PM] <Inkanobi> Ignore Fate Grand Order
[11/23/18, 9:31:59 PM] <gibbonobo> @Strippin have you seen baki the grappler
[11/23/18, 9:32:01 PM] <FrackingBiscuit> Don't, the VN is even worse
[11/23/18, 9:32:01 PM] <ArgentEsper> Honestly, that's the best attitude to have watching anime. "Here are the basics, let's enjoy the ride."
[11/23/18, 9:32:02 PM] <bromanatee> @buzzkillington_ yeeeeee
[11/23/18, 9:32:03 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Haven't watched fate since the new stay/night came, are the newer worth watching?
[11/23/18, 9:32:05 PM] <Inkanobi> Grand Order
[11/23/18, 9:32:06 PM] <Nekros4442> Fate Grand Order
[11/23/18, 9:32:10 PM] <Nobleprinceps> Stay/night?
[11/23/18, 9:32:11 PM] <BWood63> Fate the traitors soul
[11/23/18, 9:32:11 PM] <somerandomlurk> slime light novel is good as well
[11/23/18, 9:32:12 PM] <Darkaros> Fate: Stay GO dayJoy
[11/23/18, 9:32:12 PM] <Idxearo> @Strippin which animes u do like? maybe i can recommend u more based on what u like
[11/23/18, 9:32:13 PM] <Munetani_> Fate Grand Order
[11/23/18, 9:32:19 PM] <ivaaan> fate stay go = pokemon go
[11/23/18, 9:32:21 PM] <bromanatee> Fate: GO LUL
[11/23/18, 9:32:23 PM] <unrankedpro2> i just watched the one with Arthur
[11/23/18, 9:32:23 PM] <spikebomb5> fate originated with vns
[11/23/18, 9:32:23 PM] <Inkanobi> Grand Order makes the least sense of all of them @Strippin
[11/23/18, 9:32:26 PM] <SmileyBoloney> @Strippin Have you watched Goblin Slayer yet? stripNam
[11/23/18, 9:32:28 PM] <Johnny_Richer> Claps
[11/23/18, 9:32:29 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> @Strippin The only Fate you need is Zero its easily the best the rest can be ignored cus it just gets worse
[11/23/18, 9:32:31 PM] <BirdReligion> do you have a guilty pleasure anime? something we wouldn't expect you'd watch?
[11/23/18, 9:32:31 PM] <Moobot> Consider gifting a sub to support the stream! Growing the community is the best gift of all!

[11/23/18, 9:33:08 PM] <ArgentEsper> I've been enjoing Goblin Slayer. It reminds me of Grimgar.
[11/23/18, 9:33:10 PM] <DManSouls> @strippin the visual novel is great because you make of the story on the choices you make
[11/23/18, 9:33:10 PM] <punk_drg> Goblin Slayer's adaptation is terrrrrible

[11/23/18, 9:36:27 PM] <Darkaros> @bizetu Yeah it's a common tend. Maybe it's a cultural thing, a lot of the Western-setting anime are way chiller on narration
[11/23/18, 9:36:30 PM] <ThatFezGuy> avatar the last airbender is the best anime
[11/23/18, 9:36:30 PM] <Darkaros> trend*

[11/23/18, 9:37:04 PM] <thatguyuknow985> @strippin Ever heard of the chinese anime Quan Zhi Gao Shou? If not give it a watch. It was pretty good imo.
[11/23/18, 9:37:07 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> I couldn't get over how edgy Hellsing was, way too many literal murder boners for my liking stripE
[11/23/18, 9:37:07 PM] <Inkanobi> stripLUL
[11/23/18, 9:37:10 PM] <superkeaton> NEVER WAIT
[11/23/18, 9:37:13 PM] <Ventas13_> @strippin Black clover is another good shounen but it's hard to get into, the first couple of episodes are rough.
[11/23/18, 9:37:13 PM] <spikebomb5> @Chippers he already talked about it
[11/23/18, 9:37:15 PM] <Plan_A_Has_Failed> Akira, which I think was the first anime I ever saw

[11/23/18, 9:37:35 PM] <Moobot> Consider gifting a sub to support the stream! Growing the community is the best gift of all!
[11/23/18, 9:37:36 PM] <buzzkillington_> What about Black Lagoon?
[11/23/18, 9:37:38 PM] <ShuttleTV> does anyone here watch or read World Trigger?

[11/23/18, 9:37:41 PM] <Sluggs_> i cant watch black clover the MC voice is so bad
[11/23/18, 9:37:42 PM] <Poptonic> Oh it gets way better though
[11/23/18, 9:37:43 PM] <Nekros4442> Jojo loves telling characters the reason why they suck at fighting
[11/23/18, 9:37:44 PM] <Enav_> BLACK CLOVER I LOVE IT
[11/23/18, 9:37:45 PM] <unrankedpro2> black clover one of the worst animes i ever watched
[11/23/18, 9:37:46 PM] <DManSouls> but thats the worst part LUL
[11/23/18, 9:37:46 PM] <superkeaton> Just watched the latest JoJo ep, I can't believe Mista made that man retarded
[11/23/18, 9:37:46 PM] <Enav_> Yes
[11/23/18, 9:37:46 PM] <Colgaldy> The first ten episodes of black clover are trash.
[11/23/18, 9:37:47 PM] <Xuhybrid> DBZ do a lot of talking, did u enjoy that?

[11/23/18, 9:37:53 PM] <superkeaton> also, Black Clover is trash
[11/23/18, 9:37:56 PM] <TheCalderos> just watch Spice and Wolf it's the only anime anyone needs tbh
[11/23/18, 9:37:58 PM] <Idxearo> u wouldnt like black clover imo

[11/23/18, 9:38:07 PM] <Bianca_X23> Black Clover is actually amazing imo
[11/23/18, 9:38:09 PM] <lord_fun_dip> Only people that can stand gokus voice in sub can stand black clover
[11/23/18, 9:38:09 PM] <Bry_flynnie> What about Yu Yu Hakusho?
[11/23/18, 9:38:10 PM] <BirdReligion> has anybody seen Bamboo Blade..?
[11/23/18, 9:38:11 PM] <FitzEldeus> I dunno. Animation quality with black clover really dived I feel
[11/23/18, 9:38:11 PM] <opticalmouse100> Have you seen Inuyasha?
[11/23/18, 9:38:12 PM] <Ventas13_> it's a lot better than when it started
[11/23/18, 9:38:13 PM] <ArgentEsper> I like black clover, but it feels like naruto with magic to me.
[11/23/18, 9:38:13 PM] <Poptonic> Maybe jump ahead, at first there's a lot of dumbness
[11/23/18, 9:38:13 PM] <Dexterddresden1408> black clover is just magic naruto, i couldnt get past the first few eps
[11/23/18, 9:38:13 PM] <Argumus> a person said they tried to read the manga after watching some of the anime of black clover, they heard his scream in the manga
[11/23/18, 9:38:18 PM] <RendWilliams> @TheCalderos Spice and Wolf is so good. Kreygasm
[11/23/18, 9:38:18 PM] <Justalittleruckus> That kids screams turned me away from the anime lol
[11/23/18, 9:38:19 PM] <BWood63> If you don't like the naruto and One piece you wont like BC
[11/23/18, 9:38:20 PM] <Xaiken> I couldnt take the yelling stripOhno
[11/23/18, 9:38:22 PM] <thatguyuknow985> Black clover is one of the few animes where I perfer eng dub over subbed
[11/23/18, 9:38:22 PM] <codeGnave> black clover is a more satisfying read than it is watch @Strippin the animation is really inconsistent
[11/23/18, 9:38:25 PM] <TheGodofStupidity> Ever seen Fairy Tale?
[11/23/18, 9:38:27 PM] <TheBebopCrew> it's such a shame about black clover because the manga is so good
[11/23/18, 9:38:27 PM] <Vanillastein> @TheCalderos Spelled "Kirby: Right back at ya" wrong. woopsBaka
[11/23/18, 9:38:29 PM] <SmileyBoloney> Black Clover is trash with an incredible fight from time to time

[11/23/18, 9:46:29 PM] <opticalmouse100> It did this weird time jump to a different character during the same time
[11/23/18, 9:46:33 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Yeah, the manga just caught up to the anime

[11/23/18, 9:47:58 PM] <Vanillastein> @Gleidur tru
[11/23/18, 9:48:00 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Goblin Slayer sells itself as really dark but doesn't keep it up
[11/23/18, 9:48:00 PM] <snowbane23> @Strippin you can find the first ep of the king avatar on youtube if you want see if you like it or nit
[11/23/18, 9:48:02 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> goblin slayer doesnt get any better
[11/23/18, 9:48:02 PM] <Dexterddresden1408> goblin slayer, is inconsistent

[11/23/18, 9:48:21 PM] <Inkanobi> Chat, any of you see Violet Evergarden?
[11/23/18, 9:48:22 PM] <Gleidur> I mean the manga is pretty rad so hopefully the anime picks up
[11/23/18, 9:48:24 PM] <opticalmouse100> I'm becoming disappointed in the last season of Fairy Tale
[11/23/18, 9:48:24 PM] <FateFaeron> loved the goblin slayer manga
[11/23/18, 9:48:24 PM] <superkeaton> @Strippin SSSS Gridman is fantastic
[11/23/18, 9:48:24 PM] <Colgaldy> Really slow doesn't mean bad though, take steins;gate for an example. It's really well done but it all happens super slowly.
[11/23/18, 9:48:26 PM] <TheKwenith> I agree the manga is so much better
[11/23/18, 9:48:27 PM] <Holrend> yeah it better if you binged the whole one

[11/23/18, 9:49:55 PM] <Danivus_> I hate when they do that thing where it's clearly a child, but they say "Oh she's actually 20 but looks immature lol" to try and make it not weird

[11/23/18, 9:50:18 PM] <rumblymarrow> I'm a 2000 year old vampire in a 5 year old's body *vomit*
[11/23/18, 9:50:19 PM] <Nekros4442> @Danivus_ I'd imagine it's more of a legal thing dude lol
[11/23/18, 9:50:20 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> I feel like the Vinland Saga anime coming out next year will be sams thing
[11/23/18, 9:50:20 PM] <ThatFezGuy> theres definetly a difference between a chibi art style and loli shit
[11/23/18, 9:50:22 PM] <somerandomlurk> yea what lewd in made?
[11/23/18, 9:50:24 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> @Danivus_ Yeah that's disgusting
[11/23/18, 9:50:25 PM] <jshay512> So this will be late but castlevania on Netflix yes or no? @strippin
[11/23/18, 9:50:26 PM] <HadieHim> made in the abyss isnt sexual at all, just a lot of nekkid kids for some reason tho
[11/23/18, 9:50:28 PM] <picezeist> too much fanservice is why I stopped watching as much anime
[11/23/18, 9:50:35 PM] <Xaiken> @strippin There is no lewding in Made in Abyss. its very good
[11/23/18, 9:50:37 PM] <opticalmouse100> Iron Blooded Orphans is good if you like Gundam
[11/23/18, 9:50:42 PM] <TheKwenith> @BunnyMcFluff Im so hyped for it
[11/23/18, 9:50:43 PM] <suppon> Made in abyss is just fucked up, but not really lewd
[11/23/18, 9:50:45 PM] <KappaSlasher> Lollis comes from Japan's mangi mega companies lobbying their entire entertaiment market for essentially pedo-esque content
[11/23/18, 9:50:58 PM] <snowbane23> made in the abyss is kinda dark head up sam
[11/23/18, 9:51:03 PM] <HadieHim> ya there is
[11/23/18, 9:51:04 PM] <ragrath> @Strippin there are
[11/23/18, 9:51:04 PM] <frydragor> Made In The Abyss isn't lewd, but it's real questionable child nude scenes. (They don't add value, they're just specifically nude children fan service)
[11/23/18, 9:51:05 PM] <EvanG93> It's rough to talk to people that don't watch anime about it because of the fanservice
[11/23/18, 9:51:06 PM] <Vanillastein> @KappaSlasher Comes from being Japan being weird. FeelsWeirdMan
[11/23/18, 9:51:08 PM] <BWood63> I love IBO but only really picked up for me in the second season
[11/23/18, 9:51:10 PM] <codeGnave> they must have really toned down the anime for everyone to say that about abyss
[11/23/18, 9:51:12 PM] <NickWin2> I am just wondering how the fuck is not illegal for making pedophilia sex scenes?
[11/23/18, 9:51:13 PM] <superkeaton> Yeah, but it's not sexual nakedness
[11/23/18, 9:51:14 PM] <FateFaeron> definately has naked kids
[11/23/18, 9:51:15 PM] <TheDepresso> Made in Abyss is literally just misery-ville
[11/23/18, 9:51:17 PM] <Nekros4442> it's not erotic if that's where you're coming from. It's just dark as fuck
[11/23/18, 9:51:18 PM] <aussielokken> i got halfway through abyss and just didnt really enjoy it
[11/23/18, 9:51:19 PM] <Scyths1> If you love loli then I'm sorry you should not be close to kids
[11/23/18, 9:51:22 PM] <RendWilliams> stripD
[11/23/18, 9:51:23 PM] <punk_drg> Bunny Senpai is the best anime of the season to be totally honest
[11/23/18, 9:51:24 PM] <EvanG93> It's like, oh this show has a good story.. and titties everywhere
[11/23/18, 9:51:24 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> @frydragor the manga is worse for that
[11/23/18, 9:51:26 PM] <punk_drg> its so wholesome
[11/23/18, 9:51:33 PM] <frydragor> @BunnyMcFluff 100%
[11/23/18, 9:51:42 PM] <HadieHim> 100% true
[11/23/18, 9:51:48 PM] <somerandomlurk> probably
[11/23/18, 9:51:50 PM] <ragrath> Pretty much
[11/23/18, 9:51:52 PM] <Colgaldy> Bunny Senpai is practically making fun of all the fan service in anime.
[11/23/18, 9:51:54 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> DansGame
[11/23/18, 9:51:54 PM] <arkoin> i hate when that happens
[11/23/18, 9:51:55 PM] <Dexterddresden1408> loli is pedo for people who dont want to be caught
[11/23/18, 9:51:56 PM] <Losingmastered> WutFace
[11/23/18, 9:51:56 PM] <opticalmouse100> Bunny and Tiger is good
[11/23/18, 9:51:57 PM] <Gleidur> I fucking hate the lewd loli shit, really liked no game no life but how the fuck am I supposed to recommend it my sister it with that loli shit?
[11/23/18, 9:52:04 PM] <Gleidur> to*
[11/23/18, 9:52:07 PM] <TheKaceMan> Re Zero?
[11/23/18, 9:52:08 PM] <Nekros4442> @Gleidur You dont lol
[11/23/18, 9:52:08 PM] <BWood63> Made in abyss has nonsexual naked kids. Weird but its a great story
[11/23/18, 9:52:09 PM] <integerfigure> Damn it, it's good Strippin!
[11/23/18, 9:52:23 PM] <KaseKaizer> Whenever the Kaguya-sama anime comes out it'll be the best anime ever... I hope
[11/23/18, 9:52:24 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> @frydragor also Riko for the parts that the anime has covered doesnt really do much except almost get herself killed
[11/23/18, 9:52:25 PM] <Gleidur> @Nekros4442 exactly, and I know she'd like it if it weren't for the pedo stuff
[11/23/18, 9:52:25 PM] <Ionis22> tiger and bunny is great
[11/23/18, 9:52:27 PM] <MagicKuhn> Being naked just means being lewd now apparantly Kappa
[11/23/18, 9:52:30 PM] <Inkanobi> Black Lagoon Strippin ?
[11/23/18, 9:52:30 PM] <Ventas13_> No game No Life is great
[11/23/18, 9:52:33 PM] <jshay512> So anyone have feelings on castlevania?
[11/23/18, 9:52:37 PM] <Dexterddresden1408> i really wish loli wasnt a thing. gets in the way of perfectly fine harem anime
[11/23/18, 9:52:37 PM] <Moobot> Consider gifting a sub to support the stream! Growing the community is the best gift of all!
[11/23/18, 9:52:38 PM] <Nekros4442> @Gleidur Just gotta consider the entire package ;p
[11/23/18, 9:52:45 PM] <Nekros4442> what?
[11/23/18, 9:52:46 PM] <BWood63> Love Black Lagoon
[11/23/18, 9:52:49 PM] <Nekros4442> There you go
[11/23/18, 9:52:51 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Why do they have to cram loli shit in so many good stories
[11/23/18, 9:52:52 PM] <Nekros4442> Yes
[11/23/18, 9:52:54 PM] <Sluggs_> hates loli but liked no game no life what?
[11/23/18, 9:52:56 PM] <Gleidur> yeah, exactly
[11/23/18, 9:52:56 PM] <Scyths1> no game no life is yet another pedo story
[11/23/18, 9:52:58 PM] <Maelzo> Nude kids doesn't mean lewd, but it does mean weird and uncomfortable
[11/23/18, 9:52:59 PM] <Morpheuw> what song is this tho? amazing :o
[11/23/18, 9:53:00 PM] <Colgaldy> Yup, and that is the worst bit.
[11/23/18, 9:53:02 PM] <HadieHim> made in the abyss season 2 is happening so lets hope its less weird
[11/23/18, 9:53:03 PM] <Majormoustache> Kaiji was great
[11/23/18, 9:53:05 PM] <4four2> Castlevania is amazing
[11/23/18, 9:53:08 PM] <KaseKaizer> they're step-siblings, it's fine KappaSlasher
[11/23/18, 9:53:12 PM] <Scyths1> japan has a serious pedo culture
[11/23/18, 9:53:13 PM] <Inkanobi> Jibril stripGasm
[11/23/18, 9:53:13 PM] <BetaFlame00> someone asked me the other day why so much anime has weird incest relationships. I had no answer other than "japan?".
[11/23/18, 9:53:16 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> @Sluggs_ Yeah same with me
[11/23/18, 9:53:22 PM] <SkaerKrow> So was the Marching Fire expansion for this game good or bad? I've seen people say both.
[11/23/18, 9:53:23 PM] <BWood63> Still siblings though
[11/23/18, 9:53:30 PM] <MagicKuhn> The Mangaka is finally making more black lagoon stripEZ
[11/23/18, 9:53:31 PM] <Ventas13_> Did u see the No Game No Life movie?
[11/23/18, 9:53:33 PM] <OneSpicyBoii> @BetaFlame00 That's the right answer tbh
[11/23/18, 9:53:33 PM] <Pnutz_> LUL
[11/23/18, 9:53:34 PM] <Rocyourface> I need a good solid kaiju anime in my life
[11/23/18, 9:53:36 PM] <ArgentEsper> Japan's culture is kinda weird... <_>
[11/23/18, 9:53:36 PM] <frydragor> @BetaFlame00 Direct them to Pornhub, where for some reason it's leaked into there too
[11/23/18, 9:53:36 PM] <jshay512> I have watched it but I have been eying castlevania but never pulled the trigger
[11/23/18, 9:53:39 PM] <Rocyourface> Kaiju*

[11/23/18, 9:53:42 PM] <somerandomlurk> yea
[11/23/18, 9:53:42 PM] <DrSpookenstein> Ep 7 of Castlevania's season 2 is a masterpiece

[11/23/18, 9:53:49 PM] <superkeaton> is what you want
[11/23/18, 9:53:50 PM] <Pnutz_> Creepo shit sells unfortunately
[11/23/18, 9:53:55 PM] <FateFaeron> japan is so repressed that they need this in their anime
[11/23/18, 9:53:57 PM] <Rocyourface> @superkeaton Never heard of it. Tell me more
[11/23/18, 9:53:58 PM] <Scyths1> Considering most of their shit is incest & pedophilia, then yes @Strippin
[11/23/18, 9:53:58 PM] <Colgaldy> Japan has the weird pedoculture because of the weird social interactions that japan has in the like high school age.
[11/23/18, 9:53:58 PM] <BetaFlame00> Too many of you just hit me with "go check pornhub. Chat you need Jesus.
[11/23/18, 9:54:02 PM] <rumblymarrow> yeah, though apparently to them we are just prudish as all hell
[11/23/18, 9:54:05 PM] <MagicKuhn> Didnt kirito want his sister cousin or something? stripBlank
[11/23/18, 9:54:06 PM] <TrickyMelly> Nah, they need to go weirder.
[11/23/18, 9:54:07 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> @Strippin japan is wierldly sexual and really conservative at the same time
[11/23/18, 9:54:07 PM] <Nobleprinceps> @Strippin I loved the Monogatari series! It just ended recently.
[11/23/18, 9:54:14 PM] <Erigo> I mean to normal japanese people it's totally weird and inappropriate.
[11/23/18, 9:54:15 PM] <Nekros4442> The culture is just different man
[11/23/18, 9:54:16 PM] <ShadowSentinelTri> Jormangander spelled wrong honestly; its a show that shares the same name as the norse world snake. is an excellent dark anime about a kid who hates guns working for a guns dealer
[11/23/18, 9:54:17 PM] <FragmentShader> nah it'll be just as weird to japanese non-anime watchers I imagine
[11/23/18, 9:54:17 PM] <TheDepresso> I do think that anime would probably have less of a weird connotation to it if it wasn't so sexual
[11/23/18, 9:54:22 PM] <Dexterddresden1408> @bunnymcfluff like the southern usa
[11/23/18, 9:54:22 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Mature age is way lower there no?
[11/23/18, 9:54:25 PM] <codeGnave> i think they just need to crack down on the anime/manga industry. mainstream culture isnt as perverted as this shit makes it out to be
[11/23/18, 9:54:26 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> Are we STILL on about anime? lol
[11/23/18, 9:54:29 PM] <Altiar900> That shit to them is totally normal for anime because you just cant be that way in public at all. Its their way of being flamboyant and crazy like with Family guy and South Park here in the US @Strippin
[11/23/18, 9:54:29 PM] <Luzahn> Thats manga people being weird though, not the culture
[11/23/18, 9:54:29 PM] <Gleidur> lewd stuff is fine imo, but you need more sexy dudes like nekkid griffith for the ladies and less stuff like nude kids
[11/23/18, 9:54:29 PM] <Darkaros> I loved Jormungand coxOmg
[11/23/18, 9:54:33 PM] <jshay512> Guess I am gonna be watching some castlevania this weekend
[11/23/18, 9:54:34 PM] <Moobot> Take Twitch Clips of all the funny moments during the stream and post them in the discord - https://discord.gg/aFtM7Gs - If you are lucky you might win a gift card for your submitted clip!
[11/23/18, 9:54:41 PM] <The_Killbot> Be inappropriate with cartoons all you want, but I see real kids dressed inappropriately on american tv, and that actually disgusts me.
[11/23/18, 9:54:42 PM] <Skynsy> is there anyone here that plays on XBOX and doesnt have the digital deluxe pack?
[11/23/18, 9:54:43 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> @Dexterddresden1408 wouldnt know im from aus
[11/23/18, 9:54:48 PM] <superkeaton> @Rocyourface SSSS Gridman is basic Mecha Hero vs Giant Kaiju stuff, but gorgeous
[11/23/18, 9:54:55 PM] <superkeaton> Very solid
[11/23/18, 9:55:01 PM] <Xaiken> Now the funny thing is that japanese people are extrememly conformist. they did a survey any young people feared attractjng attention the most
[11/23/18, 9:55:03 PM] <Uvahash> Most of japanese culture is horrifying
[11/23/18, 9:55:07 PM] <Rocyourface> Oooh..let me go youtube this and see. I am a sucker for mech vs kaiju
[11/23/18, 9:55:13 PM] <ShadowSentinelTri> @darkaros i won't spoil anything here, but that PT through me off
[11/23/18, 9:55:17 PM] <EvanG93> @The_Killbot like what
[11/23/18, 9:55:27 PM] <VauntDanial> I mean Japan also has an age of consent of like 13 so theres that that probably feeds into it
[11/23/18, 9:55:29 PM] <draemyn> @Strippin Have you seen Katanagatari?
[11/23/18, 9:55:29 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> Gridman is also bursting at the seams with fanservice, which is good if you're into that
[11/23/18, 9:55:31 PM] <tentaclefather> Its amazing
[11/23/18, 9:55:33 PM] <Danivus_> Better to have it in a medium that hurts no one, than actual kiddy porn I suppose
[11/23/18, 9:55:33 PM] <superkeaton> @Rocyourface it's up on crunchyroll if you like
[11/23/18, 9:55:34 PM] <bizetu> season 2 is like really bad though
[11/23/18, 9:55:36 PM] <BetaFlame00> i feel like the anime incest infiltrating our normal porn is payback for the bombs.
[11/23/18, 9:55:39 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> anime isn't japanese culture guys
[11/23/18, 9:55:44 PM] <Rocyourface> @superkeaton Perfect! Thank you stripLuv
[11/23/18, 9:55:44 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> The guy who did netflix castlevania wants to do berserk
[11/23/18, 9:55:49 PM] <Darkaros> @ShadowSentinelTri I don't remember the PT at all stripBlank
[11/23/18, 9:55:49 PM] <colourkind> not entirely but it reflects it
[11/23/18, 9:55:50 PM] <Vanillastein> @VauntDanial Pretty sure that's the national AOC, but it's not actually that low anywhere in the country.
[11/23/18, 9:55:52 PM] <superkeaton> @Rocyourface rooHug
[11/23/18, 9:55:54 PM] <Gleidur> @bizetu I find it the complete opposite, first season was lame and season 2 was good shit
[11/23/18, 9:55:56 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Animation allows for so many sick stories, it is a shame it's often used for trash
[11/23/18, 9:55:57 PM] <Dexterddresden1408> @bunnymcfluff southern usa is real Christian and conservative but has sex shops and strip clubs everywhere
[11/23/18, 9:56:03 PM] <Pnutz_> Anime is still part of their culture, although it doesnt represent them as a whole
[11/23/18, 9:56:04 PM] <The_Killbot> @EvanG93 Some talent show with little girls dancing around in tights and makeup, shit that is objectively designed to increase sex appeal, undeniably sexing up the kids.
[11/23/18, 9:56:09 PM] <somerandomlurk> too bad the berserk anime are all so terrible
[11/23/18, 9:56:11 PM] <bromanatee> the amount of revenges in this fight LUL
[11/23/18, 9:56:17 PM] <Darkue> Aren't the Castlevania guys doing Devil may cry?
[11/23/18, 9:56:18 PM] <snowbane23> @Strippin you can find the the first ep of the king's avatar on youtube if you want to see if you'll like it
[11/23/18, 9:56:18 PM] <Nekros4442> @LiskWithoutBasil That's the same about ANY entertainment medium man
[11/23/18, 9:56:21 PM] <BWood63> The new beserk makes me sad
[11/23/18, 9:56:23 PM] <EvanG93> @The_Killbot Oh I see, that TLC bullshit.
[11/23/18, 9:56:27 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> man, Berserk by the Netflix Castlevania team would probably be actually good, and do the source material justice stripBlank
[11/23/18, 9:56:31 PM] <ShadowSentinelTri> @darkaros rewatch it honestly it's intense
[11/23/18, 9:56:33 PM] <VauntDanial> @Vanillastein I mean its still national law which they havent changed yet
[11/23/18, 9:56:38 PM] <integerfigure> Land of the Lustrous is getting an english dub.
[11/23/18, 9:56:40 PM] <Colgaldy> Tencent put all of Kings Avatar on youtube IIRC
[11/23/18, 9:56:41 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> @Nekros4442 I guess you're right :(
[11/23/18, 9:56:43 PM] <bromanatee> the king's avatar is good, but the first few episodes are rough
[11/23/18, 9:56:48 PM] <robinwaterweasel> it would be amazing
[11/23/18, 9:56:54 PM] <robinwaterweasel> SAM
[11/23/18, 9:56:54 PM] <CokedupChocobo> Berserk is great

[11/23/18, 9:57:12 PM] <superkeaton> @Radical_Dreamer apparently the creator is trying to get Devil May Cry and wants to do a Berserk adaptation real bad
[11/23/18, 9:57:14 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> Berserk is considered a classic

[11/23/18, 9:57:39 PM] <bromanatee> it's not that new beserk is strange, it's that it's so conventional compared to what old beserk was

[11/23/18, 9:57:41 PM] <The33rd> Anime is a mistake
[11/23/18, 9:57:41 PM] <Rocyourface> @somerandomlurk Agreed. The story is still good. The animation style takes getting use to
[11/23/18, 9:57:45 PM] <Darkaros> @HadieHim Where do Light Novels fall in that spectrum Kappa
[11/23/18, 9:57:46 PM] <snowbane23> @Strippin head up it not like log horizon where they are stuck in a game but it about a game and is serious like it
[11/23/18, 9:57:50 PM] <Pnutz_> Mange takes up way less of my time personally, I rarely watch Anime anymore

[11/23/18, 9:58:12 PM] <Uvahash> The netflix castlevania show is so good because Ada Shankar specifically hired people who were fans of castlevania to make it, they might not do aswell with Berserk

[11/23/18, 9:58:29 PM] <superkeaton> @Uvahash Ada is an admitted huge Berserk fan
[11/23/18, 9:58:35 PM] <Raen_> i would call castlevania good; i'd call it entertaining, but not good
[11/23/18, 9:58:38 PM] <Raen_> *wouldn't
[11/23/18, 9:58:40 PM] <Rocyourface> @BetaFlame00 YES!
[11/23/18, 9:58:42 PM] <Nekros4442> Kirby having to save the entire videogame universe in Smash Ultimate is the most anime storyline

[11/23/18, 9:58:59 PM] <Inkanobi> @Rocyourface @BetaFlame00 Let's ignore the animation itself. Good story?
[11/23/18, 9:59:04 PM] <dilettantisch> Are there anime written by teams of writers?

[11/23/18, 9:59:09 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> @BetaFlame00 dude, the part at the end of episode 2 where all the audio cuts out and the character just says "Ghidorah." OOF. CHILLS.
[11/23/18, 9:59:10 PM] <Tubit> Berserk starts out amazing and kind of peters out. Takes a good while before it starts lacking though
[11/23/18, 9:59:11 PM] <html5duck> like dragonball D:
[11/23/18, 9:59:14 PM] <Rocyourface> @BetaFlame00 I am a sucker for Godzilla as is, so I was really excited for it.

[11/23/18, 9:59:24 PM] <Nekros4442> Have you seen Re:Creators Sam?
[11/23/18, 9:59:26 PM] <BetaFlame00> @Inkanobi It is a vastly different take ion Godzilla, but holy fuck is Godzilla a force in it
[11/23/18, 9:59:26 PM] <bromanatee> yeah he definitely meant to end beserk a couple arcs ago
[11/23/18, 9:59:27 PM] <Erigo> I mean Miura at the very least knows how he wants it to end
[11/23/18, 9:59:28 PM] <Sir_Pinkly> Like Sherlock.

[11/23/18, 10:01:29 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> one of my favourite things about Netflix godzilla is all the parts where he like, roars so loud that there's no sound? So good

[11/23/18, 10:02:01 PM] <BetaFlame00> @Rocyourface Did you go in expecting giant robots vs monsters fun times? Because i have seen two camps for it. the "OMG THE STORY WAS SO SHIT" and the "fuck YES GIANT ROBOTS"

[11/23/18, 10:02:41 PM] <Rocyourface> @BetaFlame00 I was all about the robots vs monster part honestly. There was just enough story in the first one to satisfy me. They explain how the robots work and give some back story. All I needed

[11/23/18, 10:02:57 PM] <Darkaros> @dilettantisch In general, yes. Usually one writer pitches an idea to a publisher and hires a artist at the absolute most high-production. Even the big animes/mangas are written by one guy

[11/23/18, 10:05:08 PM] <Nobleprinceps> @Strippin What about thicc lolis like in Terra?
[11/23/18, 10:05:10 PM] <tyrocantus> honestly most people just make lolis short girls
[11/23/18, 10:05:10 PM] <Nekros4442> Usually it's just a young looking girl
[11/23/18, 10:05:11 PM] <rumblymarrow> I watched pacific rim does that count? @Rocyourface stripSad
[11/23/18, 10:05:15 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> I most definately wouldn't associate Hestia with loli
[11/23/18, 10:05:15 PM] <opticalmouse100> lol Rocyourface
[11/23/18, 10:05:15 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> Who's Hestia?
[11/23/18, 10:05:17 PM] <Ventas13_> One punch man manga has been amazing can't wait for S2
[11/23/18, 10:05:17 PM] <BWood63> @KaseKaizer I choked thanks
[11/23/18, 10:05:18 PM] <garrand3> stripLUL
[11/23/18, 10:05:22 PM] <ABandofPancakes> Loli is under 18, or occasionally a thousand year old dragon that looks like a little girl
[11/23/18, 10:05:23 PM] <Rocyourface> @rumblymarrow Hmmm..its a good start. You can stay
[11/23/18, 10:05:25 PM] <Inkanobi> @Rocyourface I've read the books lol. It's really endearing how they got strapped together lol
[11/23/18, 10:05:25 PM] <KaseKaizer> SeemsGood
[11/23/18, 10:05:26 PM] <frydragor> I think they have a term for it - Legal Loli or something?
[11/23/18, 10:05:36 PM] <Gatorboy150> and you guys wonder why people think weebs are weird DansGame
[11/23/18, 10:05:44 PM] <the__harlan> eww
[11/23/18, 10:05:45 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> "Low-Loli" is the term, I think
[11/23/18, 10:05:45 PM] <Rocyourface> @Inkanobi UGH its just so annoying how heavy she is on him lmao.
[11/23/18, 10:05:48 PM] <Nekros4442> @Gatorboy150 Who said we were wondering
[11/23/18, 10:05:48 PM] <Idxearo> give Hellsing Ultimate 1 episode, u will like it @Strippin :)

[11/23/18, 10:05:51 PM] <7_r_3_v_0_r> @Strippin i don't like soiling myself either sam
[11/23/18, 10:05:51 PM] <KaseKaizer> like the manga or the webcomic?
[11/23/18, 10:05:52 PM] <BunnyMcFluff> anime has a problem where there are a million clones when one trope gets popular, its worse then the games industry is when mobas and battle royale got popular
[11/23/18, 10:05:54 PM] <Gleidur> as a man but also feminist, I feel like we need to cut the loli shit but ramp up the lewd muscular dudes an equal amount to the big anime tiddies. For equality my dudes
[11/23/18, 10:05:57 PM] <rumblymarrow> stripLuv @Rocyourface
[11/23/18, 10:05:58 PM] <eafqf> dont get your hopes up it changed studio

[11/23/18, 10:06:22 PM] <Ventas13_> just saying but the next big main bad guy for one punch is scary AG

[11/23/18, 10:06:41 PM] <somerandomlurk> there are better shows
[11/23/18, 10:06:42 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> You get a better apprieciation of the animation if you read the manga
[11/23/18, 10:06:44 PM] <buzzkillington_> It's a shame the studio for OPM changed, no way the new studio will do the animation as well as Madhouse
[11/23/18, 10:06:46 PM] <Vanillastein> @Strippin Don't waste your time. Watch Kirby: Right back at ya.
[11/23/18, 10:06:49 PM] <frydragor> I've been trying for years, hasn't worked out yet
[11/23/18, 10:06:51 PM] <SirAlleners> i thought index season 3 is out
[11/23/18, 10:06:51 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> time for clown boners

[11/23/18, 10:07:02 PM] <ABandofPancakes> I didnt think it was that bad. There's a dude whose power is having a giant pipe
[11/23/18, 10:07:08 PM] <opticalmouse100> Better something you've never seen then something you don't like
[11/23/18, 10:07:12 PM] <KuroXXII> HXH is alright, I just think you can go for better stuff :)
[11/23/18, 10:07:14 PM] <superkeaton> H x H is pretty good shonen. It's also very old, older than most shonen people are familiar with.
[11/23/18, 10:07:15 PM] <Pnutz_> Mob Psycho season 2 tho PogChamp
[11/23/18, 10:07:22 PM] <snowbane23> fun fact madhouse did both one punch man and overlord
[11/23/18, 10:07:24 PM] <Ophirin> Uhhh depending on how far they go
[11/23/18, 10:07:28 PM] <Radical_Dreamer> Mob Psycho is also very good
[11/23/18, 10:07:30 PM] <dopplegangeroo> @Strippin I found a song like VIDIR, "Wolf Totem" by The Hu
[11/23/18, 10:07:31 PM] <Gleidur> I never gave a shit about the ant arc of hxh and had to horribly find out that was most of the anime PepeHands
[11/23/18, 10:07:36 PM] <rumblymarrow> OPM season two spoilers .... he kills the dude in one punch
[11/23/18, 10:07:37 PM] <Ophirin> Either Season 2 or 3 will end very interestingly
[11/23/18, 10:07:39 PM] <LiskWithoutBasil> Mob psycho is getting a second season in spring
[11/23/18, 10:07:43 PM] <NSparkle> when is OPM s2 chat?

[11/23/18, 10:07:44 PM] <dopplegangeroo> H x H was the purest form of shonen I've ever seen, almost no filler
[11/23/18, 10:07:45 PM] <Nekros4442> HxH is just.....a worse green Naruto than the green Naruto in BnH
[11/23/18, 10:07:48 PM] <KuroXXII> I find Yo Yo Hakusho to be more fun to watch then HXH personally but that's just me
[11/23/18, 10:07:59 PM] <Colgaldy> Madhouse is also notorious for never doing second seasons. We were lucky they did more Overlord.
[11/23/18, 10:08:00 PM] <Ventas13_> OPM S2 adds a lot more fun characters.
[11/23/18, 10:08:02 PM] <frydragor> @NSparkle Q1 2019, apparently
[11/23/18, 10:08:03 PM] <Marauder300> story for OPM season 2 is going to be crazy

[11/23/18, 10:09:27 PM] <Tubit> lots of loose ends to build on in one punch
[11/23/18, 10:09:29 PM] <Inkanobi> King is hilarious

[11/23/18, 10:10:06 PM] <Inkanobi> You start cheering for the bad guys sometimes
[11/23/18, 10:10:07 PM] <Darkaros> anti-climatically?

[11/23/18, 10:10:55 PM] <frydragor> Speaking of Mumen Rider, must confess that I recently accidently binged Kamen Rider Amazon (live action) on Prime Video two weeks ago. Such a weird show
[11/23/18, 10:10:56 PM] <Nekros4442> You just dont use Saitama lol
[11/23/18, 10:10:56 PM] <rumblymarrow> yeah, saitama is almost a side character
[11/23/18, 10:11:00 PM] <BirdsGetTheGirls> another really smart anime is rick and morty

[11/23/18, 10:11:28 PM] <Rocyourface> That's what I love about OPM. Everyone gets their ass kicked, then he just shows up, boops the enemy, and wins.

[11/23/18, 10:12:24 PM] <Velot> I feel like OPM can never be as emotionally engaging as MHA purely because of its premise. It's all ultimately one big gag.

[11/23/18, 10:18:30 PM] <integerfigure> If someone is going to use voice chat, they should introduce themselves at the beginning of the game. Nothing is more jarring and off putting them someone criticizing you in the middle of a match.

[11/23/18, 10:36:00 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> Stealth shouldn't be a thing. Who the fuck sneaks on a battlefield. No soldier who specializes in not being noticed is on a battlefield
[11/23/18, 10:36:15 PM] <Inkanobi> Shinobi?
[11/23/18, 10:36:27 PM] <ZeroDarkBlaze> Yea twitch that is what I buy

[11/23/18, 10:36:52 PM] <PumpkinSpicedCome> They wouldn't be on a battlefield lol they'd be in camps
[11/23/18, 10:36:55 PM] <Inkanobi> Lots of people hid in battlefield lol
[11/23/18, 10:37:06 PM] <integerfigure> The thing I hate most about Stealth is the fact that you can't target them with abilities.
[11/23/18, 10:37:10 PM] <NoProJoe> I mean on battlefields you also don't get minimaps or HUDs
[11/23/18, 10:37:25 PM] <NoProJoe> so you can literally hide by just... not being in LOS
[11/23/18, 10:37:28 PM] <WizardofAahz> is this guy actually saying stealth was not a battlefield tactic
[11/23/18, 10:37:33 PM] <simpliv> And most footsoldiers don't wear colors
[11/23/18, 10:37:36 PM] <NoProJoe> Yes he seems to be
