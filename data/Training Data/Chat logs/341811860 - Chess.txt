[11/28/18, 10:00:09 AM] <bassgrok> Why risk the entire championship, and highest rating, and potentially lose when having an advantage, on one single complicated position? And with 11 draws and Fabi having white, he certainly was preparing for the rapid games. Risk it all and throw out all that prep? Makes sense to me to take a draw and go into the rapid games.

[11/28/18, 10:00:16 AM] <Moobot> They drew for colors at the opening ceremony for the first game and Caruana starts game 1 with the white pieces. After game 6, they will reverse the order, so Carlsen gets the white pieces for game 6 and 7.

[11/28/18, 10:03:10 AM] <Sayahdina> without the draw offer they will just use threefold repetion instead
[11/28/18, 10:03:10 AM] <Daywen> See the video of Kasparov saying he himself was programmed for a draw in world championship? see tweet from viditchess
[11/28/18, 10:03:11 AM] <Alia_A> No, it's always possible to have 3 repetations. And removing that would be a bit weird as they might also be the only non-losing moves at that time.
[11/28/18, 10:03:11 AM] <nizidramaniiyt> you would have to remove three fold repetition as well

[11/28/18, 10:07:12 AM] <ganjikidd> Magnus likes playing at high speed and wanted this tie break situation. I think he offered the draw to push for the speed chess tie break, where he feels he has an advantage. Magnus will apply pressure. Magnus to win. HSWP

[11/28/18, 10:07:51 AM] <Cykk0> i actually like a specific rule in chinese chess, if you force the opponent out of moves, and their king can only enter an illegal space (a check), it's considered checkmate, not stalemate. this change may dramatically alter how often draws occur

[11/28/18, 10:32:31 AM] <Moobot> In the WC if it's 6-6 after the 12 classical games there will be a best of 4 Rapid (25+10). If tied after the Rapid, then a best of 2 Blitz (5+3) games will be played ‚Äì this blitz section will be repeated over and over 5 total times until a winner is found. If they are still tied after the 5th blitz match an Armageddon (5vs4 time-odds) game will be played. If white or black wins this, they win the title. If it's a draw in the Armageddon game, Black wins the title.
[11/28/18, 10:32:31 AM] <sanjayrame123> @chessbae94 @Chess Players may have all the reasons in the world to do this sort of thing, but Chess will never be taken seriously as a sport/competition and continue to struggle to attract corporate sponsorship until the draw offer is removed.

[11/28/18, 10:34:30 AM] <imgiovanni2> Agree with the draw issue‚Äîperhaps they should limit the number of draws a player can offer so they are used strategically instead of as a default mode. Allow them to offer 4 draws each, which means the remaining 4 games must be decided by a mate or resignation.

[11/28/18, 10:39:50 AM] <ag3076> There is no way to eliminate the draw in chess. There should be some reasonable limits like they have now, draw can be offered before move 30. Carlsen should.NOT have offered the draw after move 31 in game 12. But that‚Äôs Carlsen‚Äôs missed opportunity. That has nothing to do with the draw rules. Both players missed multiple winning chances in various games. Those are missed opportunities by the pLayers, less than stellar play if you will. That does not mean there is anything wrong with the draw ru

[11/28/18, 11:43:50 AM] <unstablenode> They could also draw cards and then highest card wins
[11/28/18, 11:43:53 AM] <loganchan_cellor> change a single game into a match of 2 games, if the outcome of the 2 game match is a draw, the lower rated player gets the win. draws are left in the game but removed from the score.

If tied after the Rapid, then a best of 2 Blitz (5+3) games will be played ‚Äì this blitz section will be repeated over and over 5 total times until a winner is found. If they are still tied after the 5th blitz match an Armageddon (5vs4 time-odds) game will be played. If white or black wins this, they win the title. If it's a draw in the Armageddon game, Black wins the title.

I was entertained every match, even when the chess wasn‚Äôt as intense or fun to watch itself. There was a moment that I wanted to walk away after match 12 ended and I came back because of the two of you.

[11/28/18, 12:13:25 PM] <Mattchess> No more rapid as tiebreak - just play the rapid games first then go into classical and champ gets draw odds. Then we would have had a match with the champion ahead from the beginning.

[11/28/18, 12:24:49 PM] <Moobot> They drew for colors at the opening ceremony for the first game and Caruana starts game 1 with the white pieces. After game 6, they will reverse the order, so Carlsen gets the white pieces for game 6 and 7.
