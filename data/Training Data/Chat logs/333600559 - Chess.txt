[11/9/18, 10:22:54 AM] <FiveCardDraw> nothing wrong with magnus position, those double pawns control lots of squares
[11/9/18, 10:22:55 AM] <Imnottheswarm> Just castle? TPFufun i'm already helpless
[11/9/18, 10:22:57 AM] <EOGuel> @annul, Magnus played b6? That seems like a bad move

[11/9/18, 11:17:57 AM] <Moobot> GM Fabiano Caruana qualified as challenger by winning the 2018 Candidates Tournament. This was an eight player, double round-robin tournament played in Berlin on March 10–28, 2018
[11/9/18, 11:17:59 AM] <mgeud> Its a best of 12 , and if draw then rapid , if draw then blitz

[11/9/18, 11:18:03 AM] <crazycoffeeman> @Shtanjel - this will be a 12 game match to decide the World Champion. The contender was decided earlier this year in an 8 player double-round robin tournament
[11/9/18, 11:18:04 AM] <maxmlynek> @Shtanjel tournaments are more random. Thats why its bad idea to have tournaments winner as WC. We need looong match
[11/9/18, 11:18:08 AM] <cyberhye> Shankland doesn't deserve the title of US Chess Champion. Since he can't support Fabiano, he should give back his title.

[11/9/18, 11:44:28 AM] <Moobot> They drew for colors at the opening ceremony for the first game and Caruana starts game 1 with the white pieces. After game 6, they will reverse the order, so Carlsen gets the white pieces for game 6 and 7.

[11/9/18, 12:04:12 PM] <DSawurus> PureDefiance here - both players likely used computers to prepare openings (engines). Is it not fair to say that computer analysis capability becomes part of being the best. In other words, how you use the engine, and ways you find it to help your game, matters!

[11/9/18, 12:19:38 PM] <Moobot> They drew for colors at the opening ceremony for the first game and Caruana starts game 1 with the white pieces. After game 6, they will reverse the order, so Carlsen gets the white pieces for game 6 and 7.

[11/9/18, 12:25:50 PM] <DSawurus> PureDefiance here - both players likely used computers to prepare openings (engines). Is it not fair to say that computer analysis capability becomes part of being the best. In other words, how you use the engine, and ways you find it to help your game, matters!

[11/9/18, 1:18:07 PM] <thedudeling> who is winning?
[11/9/18, 1:18:09 PM] <Sk4rm0ry> carlsen taking an uncharacteristically sharp approach. he probably could have done just as well playing to exploit the weak dark squares on the queenside or the doubled h-pawns. if it works it's probably only because caruana is already low on time
[11/9/18, 1:18:10 PM] <aquadomechamp138> @gmcanty what’s good?
[11/9/18, 1:18:11 PM] <shugy0> @merger3 Magnus up 0.5
[11/9/18, 1:18:12 PM] <Artemis727> @OranaSupAAAFM he's so good. he sees magnus's move all the time. Hess for new challenger

[11/9/18, 1:23:22 PM] <chessbae94> The moves are being held by Agon/FIDE and the relay isn't going to be as fast as watching Magnus and Fabi move on the board - but we have all the moves here now
