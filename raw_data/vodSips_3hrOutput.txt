[18-11-8 06:48:44] <neckty> You can tame and sell horses but it’s not worth it
[18-11-8 06:48:46] <zelaesh> @Currymcflurry123 if you save after pushing the button to pick up the gold bar but before he does it and reload it adds it to your inventory and leaves it in the world to do again and again
[18-11-8 06:48:48] <JuicyX3> @usmcthomasw he doesnt dead eye to hunt so itll be hard :p

[18-11-8 07:56:42] <Oliebolleke> If you bounty is low enough, you can sometimes simply surrender to the nearest lawman before things escalate by targeting them and pressing Y or Triangle to surrender, and putting away your weapons.

[18-11-8 09:32:53] <ZevonFB> The oxygen theory was thought to be the reason, but recently it was proved that the air is not to blame. Can’t remember much else but that ain’t it chief.
[18-11-8 09:32:54] <Calamity_Sam> Yes they have. They basically stopped evolving millions of years ago because they min/maxed into an OP build

[18-11-8 09:35:10] <TheSteelRodent> The War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States, the United Kingdom, and their respective allies from June 1812 to February 1815. Historians in Britain often see it as a minor theater of the Napoleonic Wars; in the United States and Canada, it is seen as a war in its own right.
